__label__0 hipstertrendy i think not very disappointingweird crowd older men on the prowl and unfriendly bartenders w lots of attitude ive given this a few tries thinking i just hit it on a bad night but wont be going back so many other great places in scottsdale to visit

__label__1 perfect place for a hot summer day amazing paletas friendly staff and fresh ingredients welcoming environment in downtown chandler
__label__1 i personally like this frys i think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly i go there once or twice a week and im always greeted with a smile a few of them even ask me where ive been if i havent been in for awhile and ask me how im doing complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesnt make sense to me since that means people like shopping there they have no control of it being crowded if you dont like it crowded go across the street to safeway where there is no one shopping there then you will see a difference of why frys is better why is it so busy because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there its a positive thing you can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off you have options
__label__0 successfully blending the idea of bar food and airline food into one very disappointing meal a poor choice for breakfast due to mealywatery eggs cold potatoes and bland salsa even the grapefruit juice lacked flavor
__label__1 this place was amazing i have stayed in probably over 100 hotels this one was the best hotel i have ever been to staff was extremely friendly i will be back
__label__1 i have shared many an awful hungover morning with my favorite stars from the gay corridor the service can be on the scary tweaker side but its a good simple breakfast that doesnt stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness theyve also many different healthy options not that ive ever done more than glance at those but its wonderful nonetheless its the crown and glory of park central and the only reason i still consider park central an actual place as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea
__label__0 nothing spectacular about the foodservice was good and the fruity adult beveragesmargaritas were tasty somehow between 2 people we ended up spending close to 50 we thought the waitress was being friendly but after ordering drinks it seemed like all she wanted to do was sell us more random crap to get a bigger tip it was a nice change to see hockey on the big screen
__label__1 i tried rare earth for the first time as a solo diner often a good way to get the take on a new restaurant i sat at the bar which has surprisingly uncomfortable seating really hard seats that cut me in the back of the knees the wine selection is nice not big but two or three choices of each variety i ordered a glass of wine a small house salad and a pizza the server behing the bar was professionally friendly then the wait began fifteen minutes passed and i still had no salad i was able to get the servers attention and asked about my salad she didnt check on the status of the salad but gave the excuse that several people had come in around the same time that i did just about 3 minutes later both my salad and my pizza came out at the same time very disappointing i wanted to eat my salad but i didnt want my pizza to go cold note this is extremely thin pizzalike a cracker crustso it goes cold very quickly the server offered to send the pizza back to keep it hot but since it had fresh tomato on it i didnt want the pizza to be ruined the house salad was fresh good mushrooms and shaved pecorino cheese there were lots of red onions and the dressing a house vinaigrette was very strong and vinegary for me the onion and vinegar were just overwhelming and i would not order that particular salad again the pizza had a good amount of toppings and held together pretty well even considering how thin the crust is i would like to try this restaurant again because there were several things on the menu that sounded really good 4 stars for the pizza 2 stars for the salad that i ordered and 3 stars for the service
__label__0 went last night to whore foods to get basics to make pizza with most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast low and behold the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didnt put something in the bag and this time it was the yeast i love the food there but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from scottsdale who cant be bothered to do their goddamn jobs i am so sick of this crap with this corporation maybe its a phoenix thing or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of whore foods but i am done shopping at any whore foods in a place like phoenix where you have alternatives such as sprouts youd think whore foods would smarten up or when you try to ask someone who works here where something is and they just walk by with their nose high in the air i understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that youre a super star but i dont work with you i contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk so do your goddamn job useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist but alas whore foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for oh yea one other thing take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores it didnt stop jared loughner from doing something horrid and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their constitutional rights i understand you think that only parts of the constitution should apply but honestly i think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower useless motherfs
__label__1 it is with great regret that i give house of tricks three stars ive been here twice the first time friends invited me and the wifey here for dinner seeing the patio i thought oh this is really cute once seated inside i thought oh this is really cute seeing the prices on the dinner menu i thought oh this better be really good long story short it was okay my friend who had only been here for lunch apologized for the unexpectedly high prices i didnt care too much i guess it was edible id probably come back for lunch which i did with coworkers in tow the prices at noon were certainly more agreeable and we all looked forward to a pleasant meal suddenly this gem of an exchange occurred between our waiter and my boss debbi debbi how large is the quiche i weigh 230 pounds so im a big girl we giggled debbi loves to joke waiter well its not as big as you bad form dude bad form youre lucky we paid lunch menu prices
__label__1 love their salad bar so much to eat not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods bcs for people like me who dont eat meat its very difficult to figure out that theres tuna in one of their salads without a label i almost ate it so i hope they take this into account my best is the whole boiled eggs though
__label__1 oh mah gawd let me get this out of the way the only reason im dumping a star on americas taco shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa i hate that charge me if i ask for extra salsa or something but otherwise come on now said chips perfect salsa perfecter my taco made me cry a little bit i am picky about corn tortillas but these were brilliant go to americas taco shop i will see you there
__label__1 i have been here a few times but have to remember to come here more often i love it ive never made it past the refrigerated and prepared foods section but who needs to you can find everything you need right there the meat section is beautiful to look at they have a whole section of prepared heat and eat dinners side soups sauces etc grab a premade one or grab a few ingredients and make your own my favorite so far would be the tub of alfredo sauce package of fresh pasta and package of chicken breast strips yum dinner in 20 anyone their tomato basil soup is amazing too i scored dinner for 3 last night for 7 2 packages of their heat and eat mac and cheese and 2 packages of tilapia all ready and in about 10 minutes seriously if you are trying to save money and still want to eat good fresh and easy food then this your place
__label__1 in short jen rocks finding someone i trust to watch my crazy crew is always a bit nervewracking i came across jens pet sitting while searching for options since im relatively new to the area i decided to book a consultation with jen to have her meet the furry family and learn more about her and her services jen is extremely professional and came ready to take notes and also spent a lot of time getting to know my critters it was clear from her interactions with my cats and dogs that she loves animals and really understands them after having a great experience with jen during the consult i booked her to do visits over a long weekend the hubs and i took our dogs along for the trip and jen looked after our cats while we were away she gave us regular daily updates about our cats while we were gone sometimes she sent pictures with her updates which was an added bonus jen spent time playing with our cats during each visit which was fabulous i always know ive found a wonderful petsitter when i come home and my animals are a little disappointed to see me we will definitely continue to use jen in the future
__label__1 does anyone know why their regular subs are 1 more than all the other jimmy johns or is that just when its delivered instead of charging a standard delivery fee ive noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too and extrasthe slim is 4 instead of 325 and extra avo is 175 instead of 075 thats not going to stop me from ordering though still love their sandwichesthey make the best veggie sub ive had they load it up with veggies whereas i have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on id much rather pay a little bit extra for jimmy johns
__label__1 considering this is the only gym ive ever been in its great they have updated equipment and lots of them i usually go during one of the busy times and can always get on a machine or do the things i want to plus they have classes which are good and every time me my boyfriend walk in out of the y a nice gal at the food counter greets us and says goodbye we still never order anything though they lose a star though because i hate working out sigh
__label__1 ihappened by during their soft open and i was very impressed with the food they have a great selection of meats and they are cooked perfectly they even give you choices of regular or moist briskit a little fattier to give it more flavor they have a good house barbeque sauce the facility is pretty simple very bar atmsphere and tvs along the walls the staff is great and eager to make sure you enjoy the food ill be coming back
__label__1 as i write this im waiting for the toilet in the room above me to stop refilling and the man to the upper left of me to stop his muffled out of key singing that puts me in a weird head space review wise while this hotel is only three years old it sounds like it may as well have been built in the 70s i hear all the conversations of the folks in the hallway i hear people walking down the hallway above mine and for the past two days the heavy footsteps of the person above me woke me up well before my alarm normally im pretty lenient about things like that but cmon this is a roadside haven meant for business travelers and tourists too stupid to see that this hotel is near nothing youre trying to visit arizona for to get some damned shut eye its a little tough under the current conditions aside from you know sleeping the rest of this courtyard is pretty nice the interior and amenities vastly make up for the absolute desolation outside its located off 91st just north of the 10 freeway theres a little patch of desert and an itt technical institute across the parking lot that seems too small to handle the amount of folks who need to park anyway back to the inside this is a newer courtyard marriott is drastically trying to get its old chains into a modernization fit to compete with hilton and hyatts business lines this renovation or new construction in this case includes adding a restaurant for breakfast and dinner and a bar across the way open from 5pm10pm thank god for these two additions because the pickins around the hotel are slim as a calvin klein model i think theres a chipotle around the corner i didnt see you jump for joy what not impressed the rooms are the modern courtyard style with lg flat screens fancy shampoos interesting art on the walls wired and wireless internetetc this location has low tile showers with glass doors fancy im used to the sliding curtain that ends up soaking the floor because its all cloth anyway if they could get the sound issues fixed lucky me im on the side of the hotel not facing the freeway id easily give another star proximity to anything worthwhile is pretty bad but the point of this hotel appears to be for housing workers in the local warehouses nearby theres plenty of regulars here week after week after week as the bartender told me a few nights ago one definite draw is that their weight room is pretty top notch and of course dead you can easily be the only one in there night after night while folks who really need to use a gym will walk by you with minds set on beers staring into the window as if to ask why anyone would try to work off the food they eat hmmm i wonder the interior of this courtyard vastly makes up for the desolation
__label__1 i been here once and i loved it food here is amazing decor is cute felt like walking into someones home its communal seating so get to know other guest service was great but before i continuetheyre closing this weekend due to the lack of business omg i recommend going before you miss out take care lola what ever you want you get
__label__0 i had a mammogram completed on 121210 this facility has been covered by my health insurance for over a decade but not this time the doctor terminated his contract with the insurance provider on 120110 screwed for 300
__label__1 the good egg is a breakfast spot i frequent on a regular basis during the week its hopping with folks on their lunch breaks and the weekend crowd seems to be most predominant during brunch hours the menu offers a wide variety of items to choose from they are only open for breakfast and lunch but you can order any of them at any time during business hours pancakes of a mammoth proportion are often seen zooming by on the arm of a server instead of hashbrowns homestyle fried potatoes are served on the side of most dishes the serving staff have always been very friendly and accommodating and it makes the experience a very pleasant one every time i am there the patio is very large and can seat many this is especially nice during sunny days but not so much on a cold january morning even with the large heaters operating if you go on a weekend morning prepare for a bit of a wait you can sip complimentary coffee outside while waiting for your party to be called its always fun to give a fake name for your party as it is eventually announced over a very loud loudspeaker for the world to hear when you hear captain cavemans party being called to go take their seats keep an eye out for me giggling somewhere nearby
__label__1 ive never been to this location before my husband had taken his car here previously and asked me to take it in today there was a nail a front tire the second i stepped through the doorway i was greeted even though all agents were busy helping other customers excellent customer service to acknowledge im there less than a minute later i had a gentleman walk me out to the car and look at it he tested to see how far in the nail was and realized it didnt puncture so he took it out and said the tire was fine i went there knowing my husband is way overdue for new tires so asked for a quote he gave me a few options and told me what driving habits theyd be best for he also gave me the warranty information without me asking for it and included it in the price instead of shockingly adding it in when i would pay like most places would i never thought for a second that i was being oversold it was amazing because i despise going anywhere having to do with fixing my car quick clean friendly intelligent honest that about sums up this place id recommend it to anyone and tell you to go out of your way to visit this location
__label__1 not a bad theater the staff is friendly and the sound is ok
__label__1 i am for out of town and came here to celebrate my birthday and it was a blast the food was delicious and our tepenyaki chef robert was hilarious and very on point this place is definitely a must when going to scottsdale i do go to arizona a lot and will definitely be back soon
__label__1 came for a friends birthday and really was not that impressed first of all it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back on saturday if you are there before 7pm all alcohol was 12 off and some appetizers were on special we ate dinner there and the menu was very limited the food was okay but our burgers were over cooked the service was slow and it took us a while to get our check id go to hang out again and have a few drinks but i wouldnt suggest making this your regular hang out
__label__1 we were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot boy are we glad that we did we are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city this was definitely one for our list we ate here for dinner both nights we were in town the majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates one carne asada marinated pork and carnitas served with yummy rice and beans the tortillas were very good too this is definitely the plate to get here i think that the carne asada ones were the best normally we order all of our food medium spiced but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos my daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn this somehow justified the obscene amount of frescas ordered if you are remotely sensitive to heat order your sauce on the side
__label__1 when checking in i was greeted by the general manager it was nice talking to you michael i hope to see you at the westin la paloma the sheraton is great for a night stay if you plan on going to the airport i stayed with my family for one night and caught a shuttle to the airport at 330am complimentary ugh so early but my driver was very friendly the night auditor was very helpful and was able to give my family a late checkout till 130 so awesome i love late check outs they make your daymorning better no need to rush the bathroom is a little small vanity area is limited but fully stocked and you get a loofa my little sister and mom enjoyed the pool as well nice small patio area to enjoy from your room too if i ever have to fly out of phoenix or into phoenix and have to stay over my choice is definitely the sheraton phoenix airport

__label__1 wow this was one of the best dinners i have had in a long time i definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that i have an entree that knocks my socks off for me this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce my husband was surprised that i ordered this since i dont like mushrooms and luckily for me the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce the gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy i felt like i was eating a delicious mac cheese with some soft foccaccia bread omg we also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husbands they were just okay to me but overall were decent we also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that i really liked we each had a glass of wine our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before i ordered it good thing i did because i didnt like it the server asked what kind of wine i liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which i enjoyed overall before tip our bill was 50 very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine this place is extremely small inside with 46 small table inside and 34 tables on their patio there were two servers and on a busy fri night service was slow but they were very nice and apologetic so i gave them a break i noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space i was very impressed i cannot wait to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing
__label__1 amazing tour with a guide that was very knowledgeable and entertaining the prize of the 90 minute tour was a bit steep but well worth it after the fact i will be back for the shelter tour
__label__0 my son and his family arrived into scottsdale tuesday april 10 on there way to california we decided to eat at rnr before they continued there trip my son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries the fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders my grandchildren ate the original fries while the new fries loaded with parmesan cheese the fries were not hot nor had the cheese melted i had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife i have recommended rnr in the past i do not think i will in the future
__label__1 yay this place is fantastic great pastries and atmosphere i cant wait to go back
__label__1 spring rolls great singapore noodles great hot sour soup not so great i have never had a hot and sour soup so dark although the hot was hot and the sour was sour a little bit goes a very long way definitely going back again just skipping the hot sour soup next time
__label__0 most livable city my eye plastic yuppies around every corner looking for a reason to belong i cant wait for the homosexuals to take control of this dog park and give it some class avoid at all cost
__label__1 great 3d imax theatersee the transformersvery spectacular
__label__1 similar to desert ridge all the typical chains are here i like the jimmy johns for a quick lunch
__label__0 the noise makes it almost impossible to talk the staff looks like the customers or the customers are better dressed staff is wrinkled sunglasses on the back of their head its hard to know who you supposed to ask for help once you know they are responsive friendly and willing to please the food is fair dressings sauced are too watered down the food is minimal in terms of amounts for the money it is a favorite among the neighborhood but these are now the adults whom hung out at the old monastery behind whitney murphy funeral home i am beginning to think my fellow az peeps have no idea what good casual food is about the service in az is terrible all of customer service in businesses here is terrible restaurants and retail watch out for the valets they drive customers cars too fast around the parking lot here and arcadia tavern i am entitle to my opinion since i have worked my way through school as a waitressbartender valet service manager and service consultant deb
__label__1 i brought dd and her friend here today after a long day of summer camp and running around we showed up shortly before 3 pm for their pop in playtime which is supposed to be from 10 am to 5 pm there are two rooms of bouncy house contraptions that are appropriate for children older than age 3 i dont know if they have actual age or size restrictions but kids younger andor small kids would have a difficult time here one reason it would be hard for younger kids there are specific instructions for the contraptions which they go over with the kids before they are allowed inside some have a max of 2 kids at a time the obstacle courses some have a max of 6 one has a max of four with three on the ladder and one going down the slide younger kids would likely need to be constantly reminded of the rules as they can be a little rigid both my 4 year old and the 9 year old loved it here they both said they preferred it to jumpstreet the girls were bummed out when at ten minutes to 4 someone came in and said playtime would be ending in ten minutes then the guy said if parents wanted to know why we could approach him upon approaching him he said that two birthday parties were booked for 4 pm so they were ending pop in playtime early some parents were very upset having just gotten there less than 30 minutes prior dd was very disappointed it took a little prodding to get her to put her shoes back on and get ready to leave after only an hour of playing on the way out some parents stopped by and talked to the shift manager she just handed out cards for another session since ours was cut short pretty cool we will use the cards to bring another neighborhood kid back with us there were just the right amount of kids here at this time of the day i cannot imagine how nuts it must be here on a weekend or during summer mornings still bring a book and some bottled water and sit on the sidelines or do as i did and run the obstacle course several times on the insistence of the kids it was fun
__label__1 more expensive than some of the other nearby locations 5 military lot next door the shuttle was nice and quick shuttle despite odd hours of the night nice enough they also accepted competitor coupons when the lot with the deal was full the boyfriend and i had a great experience and prompt service at all hours of the night it also seems more secure loved it
__label__1 okseriously just ok green salsa was horribly sweet and gel like it had no taste of tomatillo in it the tacos were stuffed to the gills but average the chimis tasted reheated in the microwave and oddly like sopapillas over all ok food but a bit pricy for ok food
__label__1 this place is busy had live music in the bar and the servers were trying to squeeze by the seafood is flown in daily and i think our bill helped fund a grouper or twos first class seat i ordered the grouper with crab on top as an extra you can ask for it this way ordered the lobster mashed again and green beans if it aint broke dont order something else had a great night
__label__1 a very reliable local garage bill is all about great customer service and goes the extra mile he deflated my fears about being taken by other mechanics playing on my automotive ignorance hes a truly good guy knows his stuff and will work to save me money if he can find it i trust bill and 25th street automotive thanks and well continue to bring our wheels into your shop
__label__1 phenomenal place for chinese cuisine the portions are huge my fiance and i always only order one thing and share it and still always have leftovers the menu prices are very reasonable including tip we usually dont spend more than 15 for the both of us for dinner they are very personable and attentive to your needs i love that it is a very dainty and has a very laid back atmosphere the lemon chicken is our favorite they are also very kid friendly we have an 18 month old son who always leaves a nice pile of rice on the floor every time we leave lol but they love him highly recommend
__label__1 i came here for the first time on a rainy tuesday afternoon for lunch with a great friend i hadnt seen in 6 months our server who was cute as a button picked up our we are not in a hurry vibe right away we ordered a bottle of wine fairly priced and loved the added touch of a chilled wine glass our food was very good but no real risk was taken we shared the fish and shrimp tacos which were flavorful but i had to add some hot sauce to give it a little bite the beans and white rice were a simple filler nothing more the menu looked interesting and the prices were fair so i would definately try it again there were only 2 things that i found disapointing first was after we ate i ordered a martini one from their menu it was fruity and you couldnt taste the alcohol at all the problem was it was served in a very small martini glass and i feel when you are going to make a fruity concoction and call in a martini the glass should be bigger not the james bond shaken not stirred size second problem as we were eating a woman came and sat at the table right by the restrooms and plugged her computer into an outlet that made the cord block the restroom door now my companion and i couldnt decide if she worked there or not she never ordered food and wasnt there long but just the fact that the cord blocked the door and could have been hazardous really bothered me overall though i give the place a b
__label__1 yes im a fan this place but it definitely does not deserve a 5 star rating first off lets start with the decor while it was very nice when it first opened its now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit if i could give them some advice it would be to get rid of the huge salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections ive been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section so why spend so much money to have such a huge selection put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value and for gods sake bring back the mayonnaise shrimp you made one of the best versions ive ever tasted
__label__1 coconut and carrey heaven
__label__1 recently i found myself in downtown mesa looking for a place to sit an write a while while my son went to a concert i had 45 hours to kill i planned visiting one of the coffee houses within a 5 mile radius but my lack of familiarity with mesa made that a disagreeable prospect fortunately i noticed lofi coffee which was literally part of the concert venue building before i began my trek lofi was a comfortable place that served good coffee but what made me a fan of lofi was the barista an air force vet who was friendly and went out of his way to make me comfortable they closed at 9 and he let me sit in until 930 concert lasted until midnight if i lived closer or if lofi opened shop nearer where i live i would go back again
__label__1 2nd time i went to grazie and both times it was excellent the service is fast and attentive and the food great the portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust woodfired pizza so far i had the dame edna and the roma pizza and both were very tasty the wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines havent made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left
__label__1 4 stars based on the sangria alone order this motherfucker by the pitcher without apology if you can sit out on the patio so much the better if not grab a comfortable booth near the bar
__label__1 i cant comment on the donuts which is pretty ridiculous seeing as thats the main draw here but i was satisfied with the boba smoothies theyre definitely not anywhere close to being great but for someone whos not picky about boba theyre really refreshing the boba itself was kind of mediocre but it had a good flavour and wasnt too sweet i got a taro smoothie and a honeydew smoothie the honeydew tasted surprisingly good for being from a powdered mix it was just like drinking a fresh honeydew melon the taro was even better although the drinks were a bit too icy for me they were a lot better after i let the ice melt a bit but who wants to wait
__label__1 i can only give this place an ok because thats just what i have had from them so far food that was ok not slap your grandma good the menu is kind of hard to understand but i know that i like chicken pho so i ordered that the first goround and just wasnt wowed like i wanted to be the noodles were good but the broth just wasnt to my liking the second time i had pork noodles dry and it was better but still not good jd had the spicy noodle soup and that was good too but again you guessed itok i havent given up on it yet because it is so close to my house and the people are so nice and friendly any suggestions on what to order wont be ignored
__label__1 i like frozen stuff ice cream frozen bananas mountaintop snow icebergs glaciers frozen caveman lawyers all good a friend introduced me to golden spoon this afternoon what a great treat they have convenient little portions for the sensible and great big portions for the more gluttonous it tastes great costs little and really hits the spot
__label__1 as you may have read in a previous review so graciously provided by dally that four peaks is our posttuesday night hockey watering hole we normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another somehow we always leave a little happier but still limping well i do anyway unfailingly we are greeted by the bouncer who no longer cares to see our ids either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now i would like to believe the latter also waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented karina bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water she humors us anyway we are made to feel like this place is home at least for a couple of hours on a tuesday night karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask just brings i usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries i know diametrically opposed just depends on the mood and how committed i am that dayweek to my diet i always get the 8th st ale though it is very good and for 3 bucks cant be beat i have enjoyed the pretzels the now famous nachos with chicken mind you the spinachartichoke dip some of the various wing flavors and a pizza for late night dining they are all very palatable i have a funny wing story but i think it is only funny to me dallas z and our friend peter if we ever get the elusive z to join i will make sure he shares his story on here until then check out four peaks in scottsdale the late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet tell karina brad sent you you wont get a discount maybe just a laugh
__label__1 i was pleasantly surprised by sauce we went here for dinner last night and wanted something quick tasty and casual done i think of it as a cross between a fast food place and a pizzeria i had the pepperoni and crimini mushroom pizza and it was great the crust is amazingly thin yet perfect for the pie the center where the toppings are is a nice and soft but the edges are super crispy with a chiplike crunch the sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza m had the turkey salad and she too was very pleased i can describe hers much as we both stuck to our plates the waitstaff was very pleasant and everything came out well however nothing really blew me away to earn that 5th star
__label__1 being a native californiani never knew these existed till i drove from los angeles to charlotte nc in 2005 and realized they are everywhere i kept seeing these bill boards every few miles and finally decided that i had to try one fearing it was something like a waffle house which id had the misfortune to visit once at 3am i was prepared to turn and walk out if it was disgusting my first experience was a pleasant surprise and this location is pretty much the same in fact every location is the same which is a good thing when you are on a road trip and looking for a clean bathroom and somewhere to grab a bite maybe get some entertainment for the road the front entrance is lined with rocking chairs and this location has water misters out there which is good because the only place i have been that is hotter than buckeye is needles ca and i think needles ca is right underneath a hole in the ozone anyway inside they have a little country store with every kind of candy you can imagine and seasonal cute stuff along with books toys gifts and such the bathrooms are usually way cleaner than youd find at a truck stop rest stop or gas station and they have a full service restaurant with a down home menu best thing is breakfast all day long and they make great breakfast if you are on the road and looking for a clean pleasant pit stop this is a great place to spend some time and recharge for the road
__label__1 papago park is a great place to ride bicycles that is the terrain can be as easy or as hard as youd like just choose your trail
__label__0 completely shady towed our uhaul as we were moving in to our new apartment complex completely unethical and total crooks avoid at all costs
__label__1 i hate to find out that there was another location closer to where i was it doesnt matter because it was worth the trip i ordered pick up because i was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring the place has a nice casual ambiance they also have an outdoor seating area i ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard since it was lunch time it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad i chose the soup but was too stuffed to have it because i jumped right into the pad thai i ordered it medium spicy and it was pretty spicy i cant imagine what hot would have tasted like actually im more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor the noodles were slightly overcooked but still flavorful i also had the thai iced tea here and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor the prices are expensive compared to chicago but i hear its typical for phoenixscottsdale area my lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over 15 i guess if you are craving it that bad like i was youll pay the price
__label__1 weve eaten here a number of times and have always had the best service and great food all of the servers weve had were excellent and the manager always makes it a point to check on us and see if we need anything no complaints and well definitely be eating there again
__label__1 i love this place great flavors love the tiny gummy bear toppings one thing i dont like is the inconsistent hours one day theyll be open at 8 the next time they close at 730 when our yogurt craving hits wed love to patronize woodys but never know if theyre going to be open i tried over and over to call one night and the phone was just constantly busy a little frustrating i do enjoy their yogurt but with the weird hours and soso feel from the staff its hard to give them more than 3 stars
__label__1 not the best burger ive ever had but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a friday afternoon i had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the allyoucaneat fry station better than bkmcds but nothing to write home about the waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair but its more of an attraction than anything else
__label__1 i love going to this store whether its for just for the latest copy of guitar world some strings or a new guitar the guy johnny is my main man lol he always gives me good deals and generally makes me and any one else i take there feel like we are the only customers in a good way every one remembers you and asks you how your day is going great mom and pop feel
__label__1 this place was awesome my wife and i have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in i had a yearning for ramen it did not disappoint we got there just before happy hour which is always a bonus but would still go outside of happy hour the menu is quite extensive the bonus is they have italian noodle dishes as well we have been told that this is authentic to japan so i was impressed to see this in the valley having been to many japanese restaurants we decided to try many different dishes and were equally impressed with all i had the tantanmen a spicy ramen with pork delicious we shared some tuna sashimi which was fresh and tasty looked like real pink no added color we also shared the seafood delight roll which has tuna krab and is topped with a scallop fantastic the last thing we ordered were the spicy korean ribs this was my least favorite but still good of course the kirin on draft was flowing as well as the house saki overall the cherryblossom noodle cafe impressed us to say the least we will be back to try more thank you cherryblossom keep up the great work
__label__1 weve been going to santisi for close to 10 years since they are just around the corner from my house weve never had a bad item here its a fun place to go and the food is great we always order pizza which is consistently good their salads are excellent all their ingredients are very fresh and theres enough for two meals if youre a lighter eater and the wings are always excellent weve always had good service and the staff keeps the beverages coming its a great place to watch a game if you can get in friday and saturday nights are so crowded we often grab a beer while we wait for our takeout pizza the parking can be a challenge since the stripes are laid out weird and theres a dollar theater next door you can park in back the side toward the freeway if theres no room in the front we moved away in 2006 and came back in 2010 and santisi was still there and as good as ever
__label__1 so great to see the occasional ny style pizzeria pop up amid all these chitown pizza impersonators sorry but if you think pizza is cut in squares or its crust should taste like a stale saltine cracker perhaps this isnt for you a great street style joint with friendly staff and always a great selection ready to go and conveniently located right next to amc 24 bring a messenger bag or purse and get some vincents to go and avoid the concession stand just sayin
__label__0 im convinced that anyone giving this airline more than one star is most likely associated with them and is concerned about their job ive been flying with them for 7 years back to nc to see my aging mother i fly 3xyear on the same flights the service and attitude of the employees has been getting progressively worse i am also a pilot 20 years and i understand the weather and air traffic control very well this rant is not about operations security or delays it is about the customer service by pissed off employees my wife said that if she was not with me on my last trip she would not have believed what happened i forgot to purchase my own bottle of water before getting on the plane in charlotte the beverage service was 2 hours into the flight this old cranky b came by and said what do you want i said i would like to have a soda and a water she said you can only have one or the other i was so thirsty i asked for the water it was a very small glass that i drank very fast and then ask for a refillplease she said i told you that you could only have one and pushed the cart away even the people around me were in shock the check in personal were equally as rude if you are watching the internet news there was an article a few weeks back that rated customer satisfaction and us airways was at the bottom i for one will never fly with them again
__label__1 worth the trip but be willing to deal with some craziness there was a mob waiting outside before the doors even opened 1 pair of dressy sandals 2 pairs of ankle boots 1 pair of pumps 2 dresses 3 pairs of name brand nylons 215 so i got a deal was is the best deal ever probably not but it was definitely worth the trip pros unlike other thriftbargain stores everything is stored by size and type of item cons the psycho shopper club that meets 30 mins prior to store opening
__label__1 i recommend this to everyone i have never had a bad meal here inexpensive great service off the beaten path love this place
__label__1 earls is earls not great not bad if youre in the neighborhood and dont have anywhere else to go go to earls by far there are better choices but earls will do when youre in a pinch typical bar food with no particular edge to make it memorable the staff is very friendly and the service is very good just average not memorable
__label__1 our server gary was awesome food was amazingan experience
__label__1 i come here about 4 or 5 times a year its consistently good there is ample seating so ive never waited long its off central so the parking is horrid their lot holds a good number but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded i dont drive my van here i am always pleased with the food i find the salads ok i really like their balsalmic vinigarette dressing ill mop the leftover with bread i typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage the sauce has a good flavor the brown butter with mizithra cheese is incredible but very rich the staff is always courteous and i rarely have to wait for anything
__label__1 i was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant this place is stylish whether its the plush lounge chairs on the patio or the old school movies being projected on the walls theres definitely an element of class that is rare for the mill avenue district first impressions were extremely positive the place was busy but not packed candlelit tables and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable formal anxiety feeling la bocca almost seems like an az88 in tempe for those who are fans i was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu most items were in the 1015 range and i was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections i focused my sights on the garden pizza which took me by surprise because it was basically a cheftossed salad on a really good pizza crust my girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto one mozarella basil and one roasted artichoke delicious top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and youve got a really good meal for right around the 4050 mark needless to say we will be returning
__label__1 saketini opened not too long ago so theyre still having grand opening specials get em while theyre hot i havent had their food yet but i have partaked in their fantastic drink specials they have 2 well drinks for happy hour woo hoo plus they have a reverse happy hour too which scores them another star any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book once i try the food ill be back and ill update the review
__label__1 my home airport so with work travel im passing through here very often i prefer terminal 4 because of the variety of eatingdrinking options for preflight enjoyment and 2 and 3 are just ok and dont offer so much in amenities but theyre less crowded and that is a nice plus also free wifi i rarely get lost in here and to be honest security here has never been an issue lines have been long going to gates in term 4 but they move fairly quickly i dont do bodyscans my personal choice so if you choose to do the same when you put your crap in the conveyor belt and you note they are only doing body scanners alert the tsa person and let them know youll need a patdown or a groping feelup whatever you wanna call it electing to do this takes me longer to get through security but i prefer it and plan ahead also if you have a digital boarding pass on your iphone or android and go through a different gate they are mostly all connected via runways etc due to the line at the gate youre supposed to go through note that they may not be able to scan your digital boarding pass this happened to us once when we went to another gate with a significantly shorter line luckily they had the kiosk just there so i ran out of line and printed them out while hubby held my spot fyi
__label__1 top notch he is now my go to barber charged only 16 for cut and beard trim but i throw him a tip on top of that for an exceptional cut he will ask you questions throughout the cut to make sure you end up with the cut you came for cant go wrong with this guy and what a cool place
__label__1 still solid still delicious i love this place
__label__1 white tank is still an excellent place to hike i hadnt been here in about 8 years i was really shocked to see all the new construction near the entrance a shame really the flowers were in bloom so that was a bonus for sure
__label__1 lets start by disclosing that i grew up in new orleans went to school in lafayette home of the ragin cajuns and really know good new orleanscajun food i grew up eating great poboys gumbo red beans and wouldnt consider eating any of these if not well prepared that said i can truly say that jennifer and the flavors of louisiana gang make cajun food as good as any youll find in new orleansseriously the poboys are spot on though the bread could be a little crustier and the chicken andouille gumbo is even better than mineand i assure you thats damn good frankly ive never had better the only thing that is not as good as it gets is the red beans and rice theyre good but not quite the creamy washday monday staple that i grew up on my cajun grandmother has jennifer beat on that one but not by much but if you want a special treat and want to taste something that kills all get a sausage poboy hot sausage or smoked sausage poboys are a new orleans staple and my favorite poboys of all but jennifer blows them all away with her homemade andouille simply put ive never had better sausageever its the reason her gumbo is soooo good and her poboy the best ever ive eaten at flavors many times even though i live across town every time i go i eat like a pig and bring some home to eat later i have no affiliation with the restaurant but wanted to post this as a review from someone who really knows new orleans food and as a thank you to jennifer and her crew for giving me a source for the best flavors in the world not just louisiana as a matter of fact i even overlook the fact that jennifer is from baton rouge instead of new orleans or lafayette and for not having any uslul lafayette paraphernalia on the lsusaints wall at least that is so long as she keeps her promise to open another restaurant on the east side of townthat is a lot closer to where i live if you want the only good cajun food in phoenix treat yourself to flavors of louisiana for me its just like a visit to any of my favorite poboy shops in the old neighborhoods it really is that good
__label__1 this go around i opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito served all day and lengua tongue cabeza head and cheek meat and carnitas roasted pork tacos the breakfast burrito was the tastiest bacon filled treat i have ever had i love bacon and if you dont love it as much as i do the bacon overload may be too much i swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb i should have figured that with a price of 250 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco the size of these things are gastronomical and the flavor of each are equally proportional the lengua however wouldve probably been better if it hadnt been sitting in the cold whilst i ate the other three items i will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when i have the option of carnitas cabeza lengua or bacon i advise you to do the same
__label__1 place is tiny and relies mostly on outside seating and parking is a bit tough like everywhere in that area but worth it the iced tea wasnt good but the southwest chicken sandwich was deliciousdefinitely recommended parking a couple blocks down on main in the art district was the best we could do after circling aroundbut the walk isnt bad
__label__1 while i like the food here it seems like the service is just really hit and miss just went a few nights ago and after waiting 20 minutes for my food i was informed they were out of what i ordered then they were out of forks and fortune cookies that being said when they do have my order the food is always fresh and flavorful the management seems to realize when there are issues as they have provided free appetizers and such when we were unhappy overall a decent place but might have to start trying other locations
__label__1 i was skeptical when i kept hearing how amazing jimmy johns is so i went in and found my new favorite sandwich spot the inside was very noisey but i liked the atmosphere the bread had an awesome fresh taste and when i inquired about the difference between 2 sandwiches the cashier was very helpful
__label__0 scuzy waiter scuzy manager overall just a bad experience the food was pretty awful too i dont understand how this place is so successful the food was either waaaay overseasoned of severely underseasoned a hole in the wall chinese restaurant can produce better chinese food and at cheaper prices search around itll be well worth it
__label__1 nice big clean and lots to chose from this place has a very nice scuba section and that is hard to find in the desert i purchased a gift card for a friend and that is why i showed up lots of good stuff and a wonderful staff i live by dicks so that is where i usually go but if in the neighborhood i would hit them up
__label__0 i got a quick to go asian salad read the ingredients no bell peppers im allergic awesome run like oj to terminal b to catch my connecting and sit down to eat there were at least 15 slices of red bell pepper that i had to pick out this usually does the trick i guess since it was packaged it tainted the rest of the salad yep instant allergic reaction would not have wanted to sit next to me on the plane it was tasty fresh and fast please check your labels blanco spare me and others that might be allergic to unlisted ingredients
__label__1 went here tonight with a friend and we had a wonderful experience we decided to start with the calamari which was just ok but i am more partial to the fried versions so that could have been part of the problem it was a little on the rubbery side and wasnt packed full of flavor the bread that came with it though was absolutely amazing hands down one of the best breads i have ever had it also had a mini salad with it that had a wonderful dressing so we focused more on the bread and salad as opposed to the calamari for dinner i decided to go with the lamb and potatoes which was 355 stars it had decent flavor but i definitely have had better the potatoes were very delicious though my friend had the duck and potatoes and it wasnt gamey and fell right off the bone which was great it had good flavor but once again i have had better for desert i got the pearalmond pastrytart cant remember and it was absolutely amazing soooo delicious and had a great balance of sweetness and was the perfect size my friend got the blueberry and lavender desert with red cake and white chocolate which was very good as well and you could taste the lavender which was delicious but overall i dont think i would have been able to eat the entire thing myself as the sweetness level was very high this was a very cute restaurant and the staff was wonderful and very helpful we had a great experience here and are looking forward to returning i definitely recommend people try this
__label__0 went here about two months ago and am only now getting around to reviewing it i think that should stand for something in terms of my experience there the service was ridiculous if one is going to charge the prices they charge for regular americanized asian food at least make sure the menus you hand people are clean or your plates for that matter or silverware seriously did everything have to be covered in grit or a mysterious sticky substance next up the menu not everyone eats meat how about a little more choices for us who prefer tofu over dead animal i ordered the coconut curry vegetables bland bland bland ive had more flavor out of an unseasoned packet of ramen and would it kill them to actually put some tofu on the plate i guess i just dont understand the hype the prices are ridiculous for the quality received youre better off going to some little hole in the wall place where the food actually tastes like food and not reheated leftovers
__label__1 was at zinc again last night and have to say the place keeps getting better still started with the crepes again perfect again then shared the scallops and lamb shank for dinner im not usually a huge fan of lamb or scallops but they were recommended and i was feeling adventurous the lamb amazing melt in your mouth wonderful more like a stew than anything with classic fall off the bone tender meat over creamy cheesy polenta their bread is perfect french bread too this time of year winter there is a festive buzzy energy with a good crowd but not too long of a wait make reservations though for sure oh and bobbys across the way in kierland is a nice spot for a predinner drink 400s hollywood glamour meets the jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day
__label__1 simply magnificent easily the best mexican food ive had the pleasure of enjoying in the states i cant stop thinking about the carne asada torta the rice and beans are the best ive eaten tacos are simple and delicious the most exciting part about it is that i get to go back and try the famed bombero burrito and other more exotic things like the lengua and menudo you must go
__label__1 i attended one of her classes for pressure cookers and had to leave with one luckily she offers great discounts after her classes since then i have also gotten a bosch mixer dont know how i lived without one all these years and also a wheat grinder everytime i go in here i find something i cant live without shar has great classes and tips on how to utilize all her products well worth it to attend a class i just wish the store was closer to glendale so glad i found shars now my family enjoys homemade wheat bread and pizzas and all sorts of yummy things that are good for them too
__label__0 ate here months ago was excited to finally find a phoenix sushi venue and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes dont quote me on this however since it has been many months and i may be recalling another venue one item did impress me and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempurad chips with perhaps a squid salad topping i should have just ordered another serving of this instead i tried an ao yasai mixed gourmet greens with ginger and a sushi roll w brown rice the latter i thought was pricey considering the very small portion given i was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that i dont even recall what kind of roll i tried pretty sad i know i told myself i wouldnt go back but i would like to give hana another try perhaps for lunch andor dinner with a group of friends and have apps and winesake
__label__0 fuck you all we hope you die thats the trojan battle cry wow i can not believe someone yelped pv my freshman year my science teacher was arrested from embezzling from the strip joint she owned we then had a different teacher every couple of weeks for the first half of the year when we finally got a permanent teacher the damage was done the kids had no connection or respect for any teacher who walked in the door anymore the year i graduated there were 3000 students and over 1000 in my graduating class we often had 40 kids in one classroom man i hated this school when i first started on the bell rd campus we referred to it as pv prison because of the tall iron spiked gates and security in golf carts patrolling the campus for potential escapees i remember before they briefly closed the campus for renovations a girl falling through the auditorium wall and pieces of the ceiling falling on peoples heads before they condemned it after 2 years at this location they suddenly closed the campus and opened the new campus on union hills the campus that was to become north canyon they built the new campus with the intention of having both schools open but as more and more buildings kept falling apart they decided to shut down pv and reopen it under the same name on the new campus they spent a shitton fuck load of money on a super hightech theater in return for letting it be used for official govt events that no one new how to use this was one of the best things about it i was one of the few people who could run the sound and lights and got out of class frequently because of it i remember making a video with casey about an art show the school was having and not being allowed to air it on the morning video announcements because we used the phrase come out of the closet and they thought the phrase might be offensive then that same week the football team had a video where they all pretended to be gay talking with lisps and flailing limp wrists when i went to the office to ask what the fuck they told me that football players didnt need approval for anything they did i remember my friend being expelled for missing too much school due to chicken pox and a mother not well enough to call her in i of course seemed invisible to the system i ditched class often and it never showed on my record at all i remember when miss lee dressed as a hard rocker with tattoos for halloween and the administrators making her change it because the costume was a bad influence i remember my friends boyfriend being suspended because they searched his car for drugs on an anonymous tip and found a box cutter in his trunk he used for work which he kept in his trunk because he went to work straight from school i remember testing out of highschool classes before freshman year yet being subjected to 4 years of bullshit i am pretty sure it was pvusd that was the inspiration for the movie pump up the volume which was filmed in the general area when i quit the softball team the coachschool councilor kept sending people to pull me out of class to try to talk me into playing again when we took pictures for the badminton team we didnt have enough uniforms for the entire team i felt like i was in some prison or some high security mental facility in fact when my mom visited the new campus she was horrified there were no windows and they used the drab greyblue colors they use in mental hospitals she had worked in to keep the patients calm i never had a chemistry class my two history classes consisted of a teacher who spent one entire year talking about shakespear and another who said that the slaves did not have it so bad my biology book was so old it had my friends mothers name in it from 20 years earlier and same friends mother warned me against my biology teacher mr h if he ever tells you to stay after class by yourself dont the good things i remember mrs toal sp a very good and supportive english teacher miss lee the best photographyvideo teacher ever and always had the best halloween costumes hanging out at lunch under a tree with the boy we called rico suave who said he lived in a box and would tell stories about the horny lady sneaking off campus to go to barrows pizza my friends wearing cut out trojan condom boxes pinned to their shirt at the forced spirit assemblies and chanting our own spirit chant of fuck you all we hope you die thats the trojan battle cry time has a way of blurring the past and making it less icky yet my sister is a teacher at north canyon and a few years back i went and visited her on campus the second i stepped into the main building i felt sick to my stomach literally i hear they have made improvements since i graduated and i hope so i dont want my niece and nephew forced to survive another drone factory
__label__1 we arrived at us egg on st patricks day at 1000 am before the as vs giants spring training game and only had a wait of 15 minutes not bad to start promptly seated we were brought a pitcher of water and ordered our breakfast the denver scramble is delicious my husband ordered the hash eggs reasonably priced quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right
__label__1 after a bad experience at a thai restaurant i swore off eating thai food i dont like spicy food and i was thoroughly convinced that all thai food is spicy even if you tell them you want it mild after talking to a colleague he told me to try lemongrass he spoke so highly of it that i had to give thai food a another try so i did and to my dismay i loved it i checked yelp before going and everyone recommended the thai basil thats what i ordered and i loved it i also got the thai iced tea and that was yummy in my tummy sweetness lemongrass rocks and i will be back
__label__1 mellow mushroom wow as you may tell from recent reviews i have been on a pizza crusade well i took a friend to mellow mushroom today and the pizza rocked we shared the thai die pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome the crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when i bit into it i am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off ill be heading backsoon
__label__1 fantabulous thats the best way i can describe the food here i really wanted to get a photo of my dish because it was a work of art despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate unfortunately between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate the camera never made it out this dish by the way was the strozzapreti i could go on about how wonderful it was but ill spare the reader oh there were also the zucca chips i nearly bit the waiters hand off when he tried to remove the scraps in truth i would love to give this place 5 stars the food without a doubt warrants that rating however the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable the acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive she was great very nice on top of everything but just a little too much overall id like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer and of course have more zucca chips
__label__1 i really want to like madcap i love the idea of playing old bmovies and some forgotten favorites the boyfriend and i went to madcap last weekend to see their chuck jones presentation unfortunately we were pretty disappointed not that it was completely madcaps fault but still my biggest problem with madcap is the price of admission 10 thats more than a new movie why should i pay 10 to see a movie that i could get on dvd for half the price i know the money is going to a bigger cause having a cool theatre in town but i just wish it was cheaper if it was 5 i think i would go a lot more for 10 it has to be something i really want to see and after not being so impressed by the chuck jones things im a little wary there wasnt even a screen in the theatre just a white wall if they showed new independent movies for 10 and old movies for 5 i think they would really have something cool going on i hope they can figure it out because id really like to see the place become what it could be
__label__1 ive been a da vang devotee for years and wanted to try a new vietnamese place tonight and pho thanh didnt fall short in fact i think i might like this place a little better than da vang but ill rotate between the two since theyre both so good first off the portions are gigantic the bun bowl could easily serve two and i had tons of leftovers for lunch tomorrow they use the fat rice noodles instead of the vermicelli but i think it made the dish a little heartier and certainly easier to eat with chopsticks hubby had the pho and the broth was amazing savory a little salty and the spices were perfect perfect to warm your bones on a rainy day the restaurant was more of a cafe style than family sit down but exceptionally clean and the service was great there was quite a diverse crowd in there for a sunday night and everyones dishes looked fantastic
__label__1 cheese curds they have been so hard to find in az like the jalepeno ones too really good fresh milk worth the stop bring cash not credit or debit cards
__label__1 ive been to silver spoon once i need to go back to really make the decision if i like it or not i went in the summer it was kinda hot in there like most places in the summer but the heat makes me grumpy so i need to go back when the weather is normal i got a salad it was massive a little too much dressing for my liking okay a lot of too much dressing but i ate it anyway ill probably try something else next time the staff was nice the snarky guy that someone mentioned was snarky buy snarky in a fun loving way at least that is how i took it snarky can come off all wrong and bad if not done correctly or if you just arent in the mood for it or if you yourself is snarky too then its a disaster its close by my work so the fact that i have not returned makes me keep it at a 3 star review
__label__1 love this lake went paddle boarding a few weeks back here and had the best time lake water is so clean you can almost see the bottom highly recommend this lake if you love water sports and fishing
__label__1 i have been going to cartel for a while and their coffee has absolutely spoiled me i can hardly drink coffee or esspresso from anywhere else i even buy their beans and brew it at home most of the bartistas are stellar but expect to wait for your specialty drinks not only because they are almost always busy but also because making kick ass coffee drinks takes time i suggest either the honduras with cream an iced agave latter or a cappuccino which you have to drink there
__label__1 great place sushi was not wrapped up tied enough so it tended to fall apart also the roll was a bit thick that it is hard to fit it in your mouth yeah thats what she said
__label__1 this review is for the new childrens library on the campus the new library is beautiful im hoping that without a lot of kid traffic it may be a sanctuary for teachers who want to be able to find the books they need to bring to their classrooms and share with their students they dont have as large of a selection as burton barr but they do have some titles you cant find at the other branches the shelves are well stocked but not so tightly packed that browsing becomes a chore its peaceful like a library should be but it could use some more seating i have to be honest that i find the coolest part of this library to be the tiny cafe at the back they serve starbucks coffee and tasty pastries at very decent prices books coffee and sweets plus silence and organization its like heaven if only it werent so far away from me
__label__0 basically im only reviewing this store because i really do not care for the employees here there are a few nice ones but overall they are either cranky stressed out or missing the redeeming points a nice selection of crafting products but then again you can always just go to a different location id opt for that
__label__1 never been in but i get pizza delivered from them now and then i am a new yorker and to call me a pizza snob probably doesnt go far enough the crust is crispy thin and foldable the outside edges crispy and bubbly great mozzarella i have never been disappointed by a topping a little greasy as it should be it reminds me of ny pizza and thats a big compliment coming from me we dont have a rays in central phoenix but we do have mamma mias yo tony you make a good pizza
__label__1 this place is delicious great food and when they cook in front of you they do a lot of cool tricks and stuff i would eat there everyday if i could afford it
__label__1 this place does it right but hold on to your walet u have to try the yellow butter cake its over the top
__label__1 i just love chipotle fresh yummy spicy if you want it to be and the restaurant was clean a huge plus my personal fav is the chicken burrito no rice no beans w fajita veggies pico cheese sour cream and lettuce guacamole and hot sauce on the side so delicious the person who did our order was so nice it was my friends first chipotle experience she was impressed by how big the burrito was im glad i only live a few blocks away because i will be back
__label__1 this one is consistent every time i come to this restaurant good flavor good service on occasion the fixings selection is a little off brown lettuce and those tasteless winter tomatoes but the good thing about a burger is that they are still good wiht just the basics
__label__1 love oreganos they have delicious pizza pasta salads wings everything the portions are huge and the prices are right and i can honestly say ive never not left oreganos full and satisfied plus the atmosphere is fun as well if youve saved room after your meal try the pizookie its amazing giving 4 stars because there is always a huge wait and they dont take reservations or seat you until everyone is there and also because the deep dish pizza was far too cheesy and saucy when i tried it more than a deep dish should be but everything else is superb
__label__1 im somewhere in between three and four stars and i know there are yelp talk events taking place right this very second as i sit to type my review and it is for this reason i appreciate what anonymity i have so i wont be egged as i walk out my door in the morning and it is possible that i expected something earth shattering within the vicinity of so much greatness read pizzeria bianco first of all i had to approach the bar for service refills and a check granted there was one guy running the place at 330 in the afternoon but my friends and i were three of five people at the entire property they werent busy we sat out on the patio and watched all the folks across the walkway start to congregate outside pizzeria bianco in the rain it was an unbelievable an hour and a half prior to opening they have at least two seatings of guests waiting in the rain i swear theres got to be something addictive in that crust i love bianco i do but i am also sometimes very logical show up at 5 pm go find a great patio table at the rose and crown or bar bianco and have some wine for a couple of hours prior to dinner dont stand in the rain for an hour and a half but i digresswere discussing the rose and the crown okay cute compartmentalized rooms yes homey feel yes good selection of beer yes good wine no well made cocktails yes menu eh okay service eh poor to okay patio seats rocking good the trees changing colors yellow leaves everywhere perfect people watching phenomenal fish and chips pretty good the friends i shared the experience with too good to be true
__label__1 first time eating cambodian food i am not sure what its supposed to taste like so its hard to say if this is what cambodian food is small quiet place entrance was noninitutive to us for some reason we walked in the kitchen its the door on the left if anyone was curious on a monday at lunch we were the only people in there around noon i didnt know what to order but i like shrimp so i went for it i went for the shrimp ling rice combo it comes with soup rice and a pickled salad the dish comes on a nice square plate so it makes the food 50x fancier just because its on a square plate lots of shrimp in my plate about 10ish and theyre large the shrimp was grilled and it tasted good but i wouldnt call it amazingly good that i was in love i ate it and i like it but i thought to myself what is cambodian food because the flavors dont seem unique it seems like they grilled it in some soy sauce maybe sugar added more salt and maybe one or two other spices fyi theres bunch of green onions in the shrimp i think they add that more flavor they arent chopped into small pieces its like the whole stem but i ate everything i always eat everything i dont waste my food its almost like a sin not to finish your food unless you take it home so nevermind the pickled salad was refreshing i like the soup it was lukewarm and it reminded me of a chinese wintermelon homecooked soup its like a mixed of chinese style chicken broth with vietnamese beef broth without the saltiness and msg adding the green onions to the soup definitely makes it 50x better as well woohoo my dish was 8 pretty good price thumbs up to that overall would i go back eh i dont know i need to try other cambodian places or maybe i should just have googled about itmaybe vietnamese food is better apparently the countries are located near each other so its similar to vietnamese food
__label__1 im on a low carb diet right now so i had to pass on the pizza unfortunately i was expecting to order a house salad with chicken when i told the server my diet limitations she suggested a side of meatballs for about 4 it was perfect i had the smallest bill at the table and the meatballs were homemade and plenty tasty
__label__1 i like to think of trader joes as a specialty foodhealth market it is simply in a league of its own when compared to large commercial grocery chains honestly there is no comparison with that being said this is the best trader joes i have been too and i have shopped quite a few in my travels across the us the sheer size of this store in tj standards is impressive the isles are plenty large enough for two people with carts to maneuver through and more importantly everything looks fresh and delectable some of my favs are 399 trader joes coastal cabfabulous for the price quite honestly though i havent ever had a bad wine at tradersthey have an amazing selection that isnt overwhelming but isnt sparse either i also love that they clearly label each of the wines andor regions so they are quick and easy to find the haircot verts french green beans are simply delicious their brussel sprouts are the perfect size and quantity just enough for two people at two different meals they even have nulaid ready egg ie egg beaters for 369 at the grocery store the same stuff will cost you twice that their cheese selection is delightful with almost any kind of cheese imaginable their artesian breads are so yummyalthough not a low fatfat free food so that is a once every few months splurge and even then we only get the small loaf which i want to say is called a little bastard that name cracks me up and although i am not a sweet eater my hubs isso he has a dozen or so goodies that he constantly gets here the one i can think of off the top of my head are their chocolate covered joe joes with peppermint crumble or something like that id go look at the box but we are fresh out because the hubs thinks that eating one box over a twothree day period is acceptable it also fun to be rewarded for bringing your own reusable bags as any good ecofriendly shopper would do there is a weekly drawing for a tjs gift card i think the value is 25 and you get a ticket when you bring your own bags not one for each bagjust one ticket for bringing them to put your goodies in then they draw a name out of all the tickets which you drop in a box on your way out of the store once a week if you shop more than once a week you can earn a ticket for each time you shop there in a week therefore increasing your chances of winning although i am pretty sure the majority of surprisesun city grand shop there so maybe the odds arent that great regardless this is just a great little market through and through i used to get excited to shop at tjsnow i am always looking for an excuse to buy something just so i can go there and its not just to try and win the gift card eitherthats an added bonus
__label__0 our group was not pleased with the quality of the seared tuna salad everything about it was low quality and just not tasty and the quality of the grilled cheese velveeta cheese sliders the cuban sandwich was pretty good though its not enough to make us want to go back for more on the good side our server was really nice and sitting outside was very pleasant and breezy i hope the food improves
__label__1 the fitness part of this place is great machines are new and plentiful good classes on the schedule and plenty of cold water and fresh towels now the spa on the other hand is mediocre at best the pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel same with the jacuzzi which also means the jacuzzi is outside why no jacuzzi inside the steam room is small and there is no sauna there are only 3 shower stalls with shampoo and shower gel but no conditioner the lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing and the robes are super thin with a chilly room thats not even nice and not very big i had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone hello haha the massage itself was very nice but the spa is not relaxing especially for the prices i wouldnt return to the spa although the gym is good
__label__1 great food everything on the menu is good the bacon guacamole burger is next to perfection
__label__0 i dont get it this place is crazy busy with no manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour no name tags on the employees i was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that i wanted since nothing was labeled i guess i violated the health code thanks for not locking me up i told my family we will not spend one more dime here
__label__1 brookstone is the sharper images older and more laid back cousin yea its got a similar feeling but its more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys the massaging chairs pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone and if youre with a partner whos less interested than shopping its a great place for them to just hang out too trust me this works
__label__1 three stellar writeups pushed me over the edge and i decided that it was time to take my self for a much needed pedi when i arrived the place was packed but thankfully they gladly take walkins and i had only a brief wait before i was whisked away to my massaging bubbling chair of goodness i have to echo the other reviewers comments on cleanliness and downright bargain for the service provided not once did i have that eww you arent actually going to touch me with that reaction i didnt swoon from toxic vapors as soon as opening the door and my attendant was super friendly and completely cool with the fact that i had clearly neglected my heals for the last two months something that was hugely apparent after she started filing away how mortifying skin flying everywhere and for those of you that might fear the elaine experience seinfeld reference fret not you can actually understand everyone one that works here and shouldnt find yourself sitting and wondering what in the hell are they saying about me now take your twentybucks plus a little extra for tip unless you get flowers you will need thirty and go get some much deserved pampering dear paulene my toes and heals thank you for the love see pic
__label__1 this is one of my favorite places to go in phoenix i love the 5 wine glasses during happy hour the bruschetta is out of this world the sundae with salted caramel and pretzels is probably one of the best things i have ever eaten o
__label__1 we went here because it was the only decent place we could find open after the suns game fresh fish sandwich was delicious as well as the shoestring fries great service nice vibe id go back
__label__1 i cant believe it took me this long to visit sportsmans but now that i have i know ill be making my way back soon enough sportmans is a combination wine bar and retail store for spirits wine champagne and beer galore plus its locally owned by the bashas family i like sportsmans because its a friendly and warm atmosphere and they have a great variety of discounts for their different levels of alcohol the walls are lined from the floor to the ceiling with every type of alcohol the prices range from 10 thousands of dollars its pretty easy to find any type of brand here since its the holiday season they are currently offering sales on several of their highend brands which makes it easy to visit for the purchase of a gift i also like the fact that guests can visit the intimate bar area and sip on some beverages to take a break from shopping they also make customized gift baskets
__label__1 the fries need work i have been here several times now and the fries have been a disappointment they are not the crispy fluffy potatoey goodness that belgian fries are supposed to be having said that everything else from the brats to the beer to the service is worth the trip the outside patio is like being at a german biergarten without all the kitch check it out
__label__1 oooooooooh man am i so glad this place isnt near my house i would gain 20 pounds in no time my sister took me here for the first time a couple weeks ago and my mind was blown by all the unique flavors they served the shop itself is very cute and modern i like that they have a section in the back with a bunch of board games very cool as for the ice cream i got the dutch chocolate and the horchata the horchata was so so good i cant stop thinking about it the following week i took the husband there again the ice cream was very good but the service was terrible it was an older lady behind the counter and she really couldnt care less that we were standing there she let me sample an ice cream and then i just stood there for a good 5 minutes while she did other things behind the counter we did finally get served but my husband wasnt impressed with the serves one bit this time i got my ice cream in a waffle cone the cone was so light and airy i loved it
__label__1 puttanesco pizza artichokes was delicious and the service is all very quaint and efficient they even have gluten free pizza crust happy hr drink is 100 off all drink choices which i love since i can order whatever i like
__label__1 i dont know if it tastes like chicago or not but its reasonably safe to say that the stuff is cooked to order and consistently greasy and overstuffed so maybe it is like chicago the atmosphere is cool i guess but im a bears fan so its cool seeing the old memorabilia on the walls
__label__1 i recently visited the arizona science center today came to check this one out joined by mike c ok its not the same thing but id say this one rules theres plenty to see here its fun for both adults kids a couple of the excellent features are an old mine to go through lots of dinosaurs the walkways kind of wind all over the place so try to keep track of where youve been not miss anything theyve put a lot of work into this museum youre going to like it open tue thru fri 105 sat 115 sun 15 closed monday adults 10 kids 312 6 students 13 with id 8 seniors 65 9
__label__1 ate here again this weekend and i am happy to say that fudds has officially won me back the burger was positively delicious and this time i ordered the fries without the seasoning they add to it perfect hey im a french fry traditionalist what can i say i hate weird seasonings or funky toppings on my fries see review for greek gyro express and try to keep your cookies down
__label__1 its a taqueria in a latino supermarket nothing special but you have choices they will have just about everything you may like its not gourmet and some things are just sitting in the pans but at least you can look at what you want id go back if i just needed something quick
__label__1 ive probably passed by this place a thousand times without ever stopping in before today as others have pointed out its small and intimate but i liked the charming atmosphere i ordered the seasoned grilled chicken on cibatta and a desert blossom iced tea lavender hibiscus apricot and rosehips the sandwich was well balanced and moist it was served with iceberg roma tomatoes and a side of their house fries kilo fries the fries were seasoned with a cheese blend which seemed a little dry to me however a quick swirl in olive oil improved them quite a bit the tea was delicate and refreshing a nice complement to my lunch selection the service is what stood out for me here my server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal even though i was dining solo i certainly felt that my business was valued here she even offered me a togo cup for my tea which was a nice touch i will definitely be back to explore more of their menu prices are reasonable too which doesnt hurt
__label__1 what an amazing place i had an incredibly enjoyable time staying at the royal palms resort and recommend it highly so many excellent points absolutely gorgeous accommodations polite and helpful staff excellent restaurant breakfast brunch outside with a delicious cup of coffee is a must a great spa and a relaxing atmosphere my boyfriend and i stayed here for a conference in late october which is a great season in arizona our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end the resort is wellsuited for special occasions there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay our room was very comfortable with excellent setup and a great view of the mountains from the balcony the resort includes a pool a small gym several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces and the wonderful alvadora spa with massages facials outdoorfacing showers and shaded lounge areas to your hearts content there are several mountain trails a short walk drive away from the resort and downtown scottsdale is 1015 minutes away by car in all a beautiful place for a special occasion
__label__1 i have been patronizing casey moores for 10 years and have never had a bad night great for people watching and the service is always great get there early or it will be standing room only
__label__1 tasty kabob is kind of a throw away name but the service and food are excellent the hummus is good not the best i have ever had but it is better than many places i have been to the chicken kabob was excellent i am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma but it is excellent i had the gyro platter and that was also excellent what i really do not understand is why pita jungle is so packed and this place is empty the food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion no more pita jungle for me when i am in the area i will go to tasty kabob
__label__1 very yummy my favorite roll is the las vegas and here they make a good one and its 12 off during happy hour i keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi try the ice cream sushi roll this is one of the only places i know that does it and it is delicious
__label__1 after shopping all over town and visiting every single shop in the phx area i stumbled into this little gem store was clean and only stocked with desirable items and lacked the items that just arent used by the majority but i am sure could be ordered if needed this planning i found easy to make my purchases in a quicker manner since i dont always have the time to sort through typical store junk there just isnt any here only quality sought after items management is second to none and the business is family owned and operated when you walk in your greeted and after a few visits by name even this is a huge plus and isnt found anywhere else in town that i have seen there is a prefered customer program and most livestock is local grown and special items are taken in a wish list and you can get called once available after my month long search for the perfect store to set up my custom order that could also fulfill my stocking needs i couldnt get my order in fast enough for a complete custom setup installed and delivered pricing was fantastic and cheaper than anywhere in town and the ability to come in anytime and get advice no matter what the need is makes this shop feel like home when you walk in if your looking for a one stop shop that is friendly knowledgeable and isnt out to empty your wallet in a bad way this is your place thanks again reef monsters for the help in sorting out what was an overwhelming amount of information into a custom tailoring to what i could handle and needed to continue in this hobby
__label__1 this is the closest pita jungle to my office i love the food and often call ahead and just pick up because this parking lot is a damn nightmare during the lunch rush if you are dining in though things do move very quickly i appreciate the staff at this location not being the usual apathetic hipster pj is known for the manager guy here dont know his name really knows what he is doing my favorite togo dish is the chicken shwarma wrap it has pickles like all wraps with chicken should i also love the glazed chicken pizzaomg caramelized oniony goodness with chunky feta how can you go wrong and its huge so you get two meals other faves hummus with chicken black bean burger cilantro jalapeno hummus with pita chips tzatziki broiled chicken salad for when i want something really light
__label__1 finally made my way up to this little joint owned by a couple of people who live instate not a corporate chain but they do have multiple locations had the deezee tasty lambgarbanzopotato mixture in a thick stew with a side of flavorful broth soup for slurping son had chicken kebab very tender very juicy flavorful and served with basmati rice which went well with my lamb too came with a cool roasted roma tomato spicy red onion pieces and more pita than we could eat had the hummous its simple tasty but too chilled next time i will ask for an extra plate and stir it up real well before we dip good service friendly order takers give input on the food happy with my selections well be back two full meals with leftovers hummous and 2 drinks for under 25
__label__1 when i came here i got half a dozen donuts and one of those boba drinks the donuts were really good but i wouldnt say they were any better than a dunkin donuts or krispy kreme the boba drink was so good though im really happy they have those
__label__1 pretty good coffee nothing special but better than starbucks by far
__label__1 this is a true gem i took my dog there after bouncing around trying to find the right groomer for him i read the reviews and gave this place a try i was really happy with the customer service the service performed on my dog the fact i got a same day appt and most importantlymy dog did not seem to be anxious or uncomfortable he normally leaves a groomer stressed and not himself but he seemed to be at complete ease here
__label__1 some of the food here is fantastic such as the chicken corfu 1495 and others like the gyro i found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish i sent it back and they took it off our bill the remainder of the meal which consisted of the corfu salads and soup was great and our waitress the owners daughter promised to address the gyro with the kitchen this restaurant is located at the park in fountain hills with unobstructed views of the lake and fountain which erupts every hour spraying water more than 500 feet in the air we took a nice walk in the park after dinner which was very relaxing recommended
__label__1 innovative venue bleacher seating in the back is a bit odd but it works dig the long bar at the far end of the hall excellent sound havent tried the food yet but i intend to investigate
__label__1 burger heaven i had the pig burger it was delicious and it was served on a pretzel roll mmmmmm good vibe feeling in circle h i like the pictures on the walls the bar look the entire environment was relaxed and easy going i came the day of the official ribbon cutting so i got to see that happen i had no idea those giant gold scissors were real scissors by the way i guess that is a dumb though bc what else would they be and it was nice to see everyone gathered for this moment the french fires were piping hot and delicious they have all sorts of sides like slaw beans mac n cheese etc i also had a bite of the brisket sandwich it was so very very good i am ordering that next time i go back local beers on tap good price too great start for a new restaurant there were of course the new hickups but those kins get worked out with more time nothing to worry about thats how you learn
__label__1 great prices and fresh food
__label__1 this location has 2 businesses a bar and a grill i never entered the bar i only eat at the grill for breakfast i love the food though this is a great greasy spoon when you dont care about exotic gourmet concoctions an upscale location or an eye catching electronic sign this place serves your standard menu items quality food reasonable prices and low overhead just the way i like it the other reviewers commented on the owner and her abrasive nature i agree she is abrasive but only at first glance she is funny and sweet if you give her a chance
__label__1 we purchased a groupon deal and went and tried this restaurant the food is excellent and the service is very good if you are wanting real texas bbq then this is the place to go
__label__0 after landing in phx but before embarking on a 25 hour drive to flagstaff i thought wendys would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the gowell i was wrong chicken nuggets dry freezerburned meat with extra hard doublefried shell french fries super hot crunchy overfried frenchfryshaped fryshells so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating frenchfry chips junior bacon cheese burger bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated guess what last thing i want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100 weather is hot dry crunchy tasteless food
__label__1 what can i say about this place i love it its straight up the road from my place you can find everything here not just asian food when i get a hankering for bombay spice off to lee lee i go i love love their meat counter i get chills deciding which pork hocks i want the fish fry service is nice they have stuff i cant live without and cant find anywhere else ie aloe vera juice and those sinfully delicious dessert rice and of course the makoks the cashiers can be a lil raunchy though just smile and nod and a little known secret the vegetables are freshest on fridays
__label__1 located in the space formerly occupied by lgos short lived radio milano the north side of campbell has been reincarnated as the arcadia room a private dining facility operated by the aforementioned restaurant group i dined here recently for the hubbys work dinner unlike so many private facilites that feel like a corporate conference room the arcadia room is a cool casual restaurant all to your self we had about 60 in our group and had plenty of room to mingle at the sleek bar lining one side of the room or gather by the open kitchenthe weather was blazing hot when we were there but there is even a lovely little patio outdoors for guests i think this would be an ideal location for any work or social occasion where you want an intimate atmosphere combined with reputable fare
__label__1 i am an avid quilter and moved here recently i am on the hunt for a new quilt shop and i went here despite the grandma quilt shop name lol the staff was very nice and helpful and friendly the shop a little on the small side which made me surprised to find that they have a very decent selection of contemporary fabrics my only disappointment is that that they dont have fat quarters cut of each of the fabrics though they will cut fat quarters but thats not something i want to have to wait around for they carry a small selection of minky and home dec fabrics as well i will definitely be back there
__label__1 i wanted to add a review to the actual companys website but i could not figure it out im curious where all the testimonials came from i have mixed feelings on my experience in the end i think i ended up with some beautiful windows though my salesperson was very engaging i felt pretty confident in my decision to go with american vision windows after that first experience there was some miscommunication on scheduling the measurement but it worked itself out fairly quickly i started to lose confidence when i was told a specific date that my windows would be in but never heard anything from the company four days after that date when i called them to find out where my windows were i was told they had just received them and they could schedule my install in 2 weeks since i only had saturday install available that was understandable the friday before my install they called to reschedule to the following weekend because the rainstorm that just occurred that day had put them behind two days again i guess that was fairly understandable but i felt like the peon that was the easiest to push off luckily the installers did show up the following saturday on the earlier side of the provided time frame i kind of dont know what to say about the install there were two guys one seemed to know what he was doing the other i had less confidence in the job took 4 hours to install 6 windows during the entire transaction i was never told how long the install would take so im not sure if that was normal or not the two guys actually seemed to be fighting during the entire install i believe the head guy was joking around with the other by basically telling him he sucked i think the other guy was genuinely getting angrier and angrier in all honesty i was very uncomfortable being in my own house while the install was going on i was a bit disappointed in the cleanup of the job i ended up having to cleanup inside the window tracks and windowsills on the inside and brush off the sills on the outside i dont feel i should have had to do that before they left i was handed a survey to review the entire process salesperson overall experience install i think that is a horrible practice that needs to be changed i didnt want to sit there writing out a review on all of the above while the installer is waiting for me and then hand it right back to him what it did cause me to do is overstate my review because im not going to give the installers 2 stars and hand the paper back to the person i just reviewed i cant say i would recommend this company but i feel the way customer service has been going its really a tossup on what you will get from any company ps i forgot to mention my plants i have recently spent a lot of my own time and money on landscaping my backyard so this stuck out to me big time i understand when installing windows its difficult to pay attention to the foliage below your feet but i think some attempt to not trample all over the plants would be very much appreciated for example when washing the windows i think an effort can be made not to stand directly on top of a plant and twist your foot back and forth im still hoping i do not loose a couple of plants due to the trauma they endured
__label__1 we have some friend who were raving about this place so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently i gotta say i had a great reuben sandwich that i was very pleased with im not sure if i will be venturing to the area just to have this sandwich again but it was super tasty everyone seemed to like what they had and the menu has something for everyone if im in the area again i might venture here but i am partial to jimmy johns next door so it might be hard to choose
__label__1 great decor great food and very good service you have to try the pork belly pastrami to die for their version of the manhattan was very good as for the main courses you cant go wrong with the scallops or the smoked duck for dessert go with the black tan pudding oh soooo good highly recommend this place
__label__1 i was only here for one night on 97 but i was very pleased with my stay the place is beautiful the rooms are big and the people at the front desk were pleasant and efficient the only down side to my stay was that i lost water pressure in the shower friday night fortunately it was only brief other than that i enjoyed my stay this will be my base of operations for my next visit as for others comments that there isnt anything nearby thats what cars are for last i heard you can rent them here and there
__label__0 so yesterday morning i actually had a prego craving i was in the mood for a smoothie for breakfast my traditional early morning oatmeal or yogurt breakfast was not going to do baby wanted something else i head on over to this jackinthe box which is close to work i pull up order my strawberry banana smoothie and am promptly told that the machine is broken uhwell that sucks i pull up to the window and the person tells me that the machine is leaking at least i think thats what he said but would be about 10 minutes and it would be up and running now knowing the smoothie issues i had this morning i dont think that the machine was broken the product just wasnt ready yet
__label__1 chicken wings and cheeseburger meal yummmayyyy ever since ive moved away from arizona i can honestly say that china grill is what i miss most their chicken fried rice is really good and so is their cheeseburger their general tsos chicken extra spicy is my bfs favorite almost everything is good here
__label__1 i ordered a cappuccino my typical order at a new place and it was very good with a pretty heart design on top which made me smile the espresso was perfect and did not require any sweetener i also got a blueberry muffin which wasnt very good perhaps it was low fat or something but i am very picky about pastries anyway my biggest problem with this place is the fact that they do not have a bathroom coffee makes me have to pee and when i discovered this and had to walk all the way to the baby gap because the place next door with a bathroom wasnt open yet requiring me to pack up my computer and leave my drink and food unattended it was a bit undesirable i know its a mall type area but it still surprised me for a drinkfood place it does not set the tone for a place to spend a lot of time which may be their intention also i love john mayer but they played his same songs over and over again perhaps mixing it up or putting on a pandora station would be better the staff was nice and they have free wifi i will return for the espresso but get it to go
__label__1 this place is great i need an adjustment every now and then but i live in scottsdale and my regular chiropractor is so good that he is always booked up ahead of time so if i tweek my back unexpectedly i cant get in soon enough quite often so now i have a place to go seven days a week that is every bit as good as my normal chiro i have only gone to the weekend chiro but my wife and one of my employees have seen dr brian and they love him so if you need a good chiro go see these guys any day of the week try em youll love em
__label__1 this was a great place to go with the parents for thanksgiving dinner was served family style and it was a ton of food started with a plate of 3 different bruschetta appetizers that were excellent then had a choice of 2 salads 2 meats we had turkey that was served with a focaccia dressing and the tilapia served with a side of some of the best creamed spinach i ever had then 2 side dishes in addition mashed sweet potatoes and mashed garlic potatoes that were just okay 2 pasta dishes we had the signature rigatoni d and the angel hair with pomodoro saucesausage and 2 desserts it is a little pricey but for the amount of food they serve and all the leftovers i think its worth it the best way to go here is with a group and do the family style menu ive been to other maggianos in chicago and to me theyre all pretty much the same good and plentiful food and fast friendly service
__label__1 just when im about to give up on my search for good thai around glendale i stumble upon a true diamond in the rough dont be fooled by the shabby looks of the outside plaza the inside is contrarily well orchestrated with subtle thai ornaments and design a huge desk in the lobby and bigger one inside the dining hall gives this establishment an odd but distinct hotel feel much like that feeling the service is intriguingly exceptional from the time you walk into the front door the food that ive tried here so far is may i say it divine i started off with the squid salad with mint and lemongrass and it was packed with fish sauce and shrimp paste score i also tried some papaya salad and once again it was mounded in fish sauce and chili splendid then i had the minced beef phad kaprow which is not on the menu and lo and behold i was tasting phuket in a bangkok sort of way to be honest the sauces from each of these entrees mingle quite well you can drizzle some of each dripping over rice and literally have an orgy in your mouth of mormonic proportions you can also bolster it with some more heat with their chili fish sauce again drizzled all over your concoction let your adventurous mind roam free and order something outside the pad thai genre it will pay off handsomely
__label__1 wow love that a place like this moved in down the street inexpensive fresh delicious everything i want in a mexican restaurant my soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic freshly prepared and topped with guacamole which by the way is super creamy basket of chips are free as is the toppings bar every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious i plan on frequenting salsa blanca
__label__1 apparently fellow yelper andrew and i are meeting in our dreams over maple bacon creme brulee im seriously glad to see that i am not the only one having subconcious yearnings for this lil dab of heaven in a cup all of the products are top notch though and who doesntlike creme brulee communists maybe chef eric is awesome and so friendly too
__label__1 of course they are no la madeliene but if you are looking for some good croissants this is the place to be i love love love their croissants but which bakerys croissants do i not love hmm but i do love theirs i have had the almond croissant the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there i had the chocolate croissant it was just freaking amazing thats all i can say they run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some i have also had lunch here before some mediterranean sandwich stuff the portion is very small compared to the price their macaroons look crazy and funky have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time i almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird but its okay i will compromise essence bakery they only use butter imported from normandy in their croissants wow
__label__1 nice little find for casual sushi
__label__1 i thought the place had a lot to offer with the atmosphere and the ingredients used in the all of the dishes i only thought that the menu spoke louder than the dish
__label__1 they came to my house the same day that i called which was a pleasant surprise im glad that i didnt have to wait a week for them to fix our fuse box with labor at 65 per hour its pretty affordable depending on what you want them to do be aware that there might be two guys coming out to you though so itll be 65 per hour x2

__label__1 we had brunch at el chorro today and it was wonderful the patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters the service was outstanding the food was delicious i had the creme brulee french toast it was carbsugar heaven everyone else enjoyed their food the eggs benedict came out perfect the blt looked awesome the fries were delicious we will definitely be back
__label__1 i came here hoping to catch brunch but i guess it ends at 1130am or 12pm luckily the lunch menu looked just as tasty we ordered the luau pulled pork sandwich the jalapeno cole slaw gives it a nice kick and the monte cristo french toast instead of regular bread slices delicious service was friendly and attentive the dining area is decorated like a household very comfortable and clean
__label__1 ditto what kristi m said thank you to my fellow yelpers for helping me find this place
__label__1 lets rewind four years youve never been to chino bandido no what is it how long have you lived here about eleven years but a bunch of those years were when i was a toddler and i just moved back from a few years in flagstaff and youve never been to chino no what is it amazing take me there okay yet we never went on the drive home from the childrens museum of phoenix i realized that i was hungry on a budget and chino bandido was not too far off of path i ran the plan by my father checking to make sure that would be an appropriate fathers day dinner i received a confused look and thumbs up hes not the most adventurous when it comes to dining experiences but is generally a good sport if my friend and i had been on the ball i could have been eating here for four years granted i rarely have business around 19th and greenway but i could have made chino bandido my business we both ate a perfectly reasonably sized and delicious dinner for less than 10 three cheers for caribbean influenced burritos and homemade teriyaki sauce stevey p mentioned the only reason im giving four instead of five stars if the dining room werent so disgusting that i had trouble eating in it it would easily be a five star place wipe down the counters and tables and perhaps give it a new coat of paint and ill be completely thrilled
__label__1 good chinese food great value especially for lunch china village is one of my regular haunts for chinese food when im in the neighborhood the building may look rundown but the food and service are good
__label__1 lovely outdoor seating area very dog friendly dont sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours it was a pleasant experience didnt order food this time but next time i will because every dish that came by looked magnificent all of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion
__label__1 great burgers and menu offerings you would expect to get a good burger with a name like that and you do the sweet potato fries frenched fried onions and salmon salad are very good too the decor location and menu are restaurant alternative for the area the menu was a little confusing and little pricey yet the quality of the food is there and considering the location of the restaurant pricing isnt an issue i do recommend to restaurant to others
__label__1 good buffet albeit its a tad on the more expensive side in my opinion we came here for dinner on a sunday night for their super buffet which was 1599 per person this buffet offers a large selection of foodhot entrees made to order sushi mongolian bbq soup fresh fruit and salad and dessert i liked the fried rice chow mein broccoli beef string beans and this dish with tofu the egg drop soup was really good and the hot and sour soup was decent for a chinese buffet they offered some quality desserts since some of their offerings probably came from costco like the red velvet cake and cream puffs service was friendly and polite our waitress did a great job with clearing our plates and offering to refill our hot tea hot tea was 160 per person by the way the restaurant is spacious and appeared to be well maintained parking is easy since theres plenty of spaces in the lot out front
__label__1 they had what i was looking for it wasnt easy to find but after asking 3 people i eventually found it a folding table and shelving the place is typically big and laid out like most other home depots know what to expect when you go and you wont be disappointed but if you want a lot of personal service stick to a local hardware store
__label__1 i love this place and their food what i mainly love is that their prices are extremely reasonable now so i can go more often their steaks are very good as are their ribs and chicken as for appetizers i love the signature bloomin onion and i recently tried their wings and i love them it must be the seasonings and sauce they taste very different and the service is alway excellent but when you do plan on going make a reservation to avoid waiting too horribly long
__label__1 good fish fry place ive also had there monster burger delish
__label__1 i love zoya she does a phenomenal pedicure and eyebrow wax i never have to wait it is very professional there the decor is beautiful and i always relax when im there zoya told me today that she does swedish massages at their sister salon which is right across the way in the same parking lot they have a hair salon in the other location as well i have been going there for a while for the happy feet pedicure best exfoliation great neck massage and paraffin wax for the feet ahhhhhmy feet are so happy right now
__label__1 if you have ever eaten at an exceptional german restaurant you will be ruined for life years ago the haus would have gotten 4 stars but after being turned on to a little gem in gibson city il called the bayrn stube my appreciation of fatty meat and spices stuffed in an intestine laid on a bed of sauerkraut and red cabbage has been forever changed haus just doesnt quite measure up the cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of hawaiian bread you buy at wally world probably the biggest turn off was when they brought out the brown mustard still in a plastic squeeze container my meal was the nuernbergerkassler combo for one and i had enough left over for breakfast the next day their sausages seem to be of lesser quality than i would get at sunflower and the red cabbage had some pork gristle in it not that i mind a little pork fat in my cabbage but not chunks and definitely not gristle my friend ordered the huehner chicken schnitzel which had a very good flavor it was the best part of either of our meals they do have a nice selection of good beers on tap no aventinus though if the food was anything other than german it would get 2 stars it is nice to have somewhere to get a schnitzel when im in the area but i wouldnt drive out of my way to eat here
__label__1 i dig the breakfast been to 7th and 38th and had nans breakfast plus have had tamales too so really is something to come back in 13years i live in cali been here 26 times and not fancy although 7th is the one with great pottery and colors inside i ate 1 time for lunch of dinner and 25 times for brekafast
__label__1 who the heck doesnt love huge amounts of toilet paper and free samples of food come on now
__label__1 canteen is my new favorite happy hour spot you can get two orders of wonderful pork and habanero tacos two orders of their tender ribs an order of quite good chips and guacamole and a couple of margaritas for around twenty bucks its amazing add in the cool atmosphere and huge selection of tequilasall half off during happy hour and you have a recipe for success canteen is a very welcome addition to mill ave and while it can get very loud you simply cannot go wrong during happy hour
__label__1 this was such a good experience i was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache i dont have health insurance so i didnt think i could afford a dentist friends and family told me to look up a dental school and thats how i found at still i called and they said they accept five emergency patients a day at 1pm it was 11am but i didnt care i drove straight there and i was the first patient seen at 1pm it cost 15 to be seen 15 for the xrays and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity so they sent me up to oral surgery it cost me 85 to get the tooth extracted i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears it didnt hurt at all i was numbed up and the student did a good job they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and i have to return next week for follow up the follow up appointment is free totally recommend this place to any and everyone
__label__1 totts is great panasian food for a very reasonable price one day at work one of my coworkers asked if i wanted to go out to lunch i agreed and we set out we each got 1 veto hers was panda express mine was kyoto bowl we kept driving and she remembered totts and ive never bothered going to panda again great food and great service the owner is a small asian man who smiles a lot and always wants to know if he can get us anything else i see him every time i go everyone i go with loves their orange chicken it is very tasty but a little on the sweet side for me i like a spicy dish so i go with the malaysian curry chicken red curry fresh veggies fried rice amazing
__label__1 barrio cafe is an amazing mexican restaurant chef silvana salcido esparza travels to mexico for many of her ingredients and you can tell things are always fresh they only have an ice cream freezer creative and authentic i am more than content w a mango margarita the incredible guacamole and the gooey caramel filled churros even when the restaurant is packed the staff is friendly and informative
__label__1 i cant believe no one has talked about pasta tuesday definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out it is that good they have this guy guido come every tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning he picks 2 unique dishes it was one of the best pasta i have ever tasted i crave it all the time i had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top i cant even describe the taste wow what a good food critic i am you just have to go check it out i am going tonight
__label__1 i like this place because of how original it is and the menu has something for everyone unfortunately it is tucked away in a hard to spot location and therefore continues to be a great secret i would recommend to anyone in arizona to make a trip over and see what this place is all about i think everyone will be happy with it
__label__1 i have had a couple of peels at apeeling faces and they were the best ive ever had they are not only very reasonable priced but darla salem really knows her stuff my skin has never looked better i am very pleased
__label__1 this place was once known as j chew and company i loved that place and this new version is still great so comfy so casual so welcoming and so nonscottsdaley its just the best
__label__1 great work lunch valet parking only waitress was helpful in narrowing down my selection salmon salad and listened to my criteria 4 stars since wait staff seemed otherwise aloof
__label__1 this is a small location but still packed with everything i need they did start stalking more womens vitamins i liked without iron because they were always out when i went in so i thank them for that staff are always nice and for the most part an answer all of my questions they take an added effort to get to know their customers they always ask about my son when i go in and this keeps me coming back because i feel valued as a person not just a customer
__label__1 the name is so misleading because this is the most charming dining spot ive ever eaten i dined here for lunch with a friend and was blown away by everything about it first its location is tucked away near asu campus in a quiet little neighborhood it appears to be a converted home built in the early 1900s and lots of beautiful mature trees and plants growing in their huge and i mean huge outdoor patio area i only dined outside but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here why would you dine any other way the service was excellent the staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while i drank water and waited a while for my friend the menu was amazing i never once read a menu that i wanted to try everything on here they had a huge variety of dishes at what i can only describe as americanfrench fusion it all looked so divine and from what ive been told their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes so i cant wait to see what they offer when i return i went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup the soup was so rich and creamy i could have ordered and ate a whole trough it was that good the fruit was clean well portioned and fresh im very particular with fruit and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened and the quiche was heavenly as well just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor since i was here for lunch only the prices were reasonable ive heard at dinner it can get expensive this was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once
__label__1 there is nothing i enjoy more than a great sunday brunch and st francis did not let me down the food and atmosphere were the perfect way to start off a relaxing day we had to wait about 25 minutes before getting seated but it was no problem because our server brought us drinks while we sat and enjoyed the live jazz music my friend and i started off by sharing a giant cinnamon roll topped with caramel sauce so good we destroyed the pastry in minutes which left both of us wondering how we were going to eat our meals fortunately we are both gluttons and were able to pull ourselves together for round 2 i had the eggs benedict and roasted potatoes and my friend ordered the woodoven baked eggs both were delicious the only thing i didnt like was that the tables were very close together at times it felt like we were dining with our neighbors overall i would highly recommend st francis brunch and i am eager to return again
__label__1 small but well stocked all of the japanese basics are here its nice to have a local japanese grocer and not have to resort to an asianmegamart theres not a lot of fresh produce but great frozen and dry goods options ill have to try the prepared food sometime they were sold out for the day by the time i went in the afternoon
__label__1 so im not a big chinese food fan but my husband is truth be told it usually makes me sick but if i were to go to chinese food dragon palace would be one of the places that i would go the food is decent and theres a lot of it i really felt i was getting my values worth the waitstaff was attentive always there asking if i wanted a refill and the food came out quickly it looks like every other chinese food restaurant in the world lots of red and gold lanterns paper chinese horoscope place mat save for the deep teal walls im not sure i would make a long drive to dragon palace because chances are you have a comparable chinese food restaurant nearby but if you live in the 32nd st and tbird vicinity this is certainly a chinese food place worth trying as for the food we ordered the peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup a pu pu platter consisting of won tons yum eggroll a small fried shrimp a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken peking fried rice fried rice with shrimp chicken pork and beef mongolian beef and the house chicken as an aside and a disclaimer i am preggers right now and i have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means i of course hated the chicken dishes my husband thought it all was ok i really liked the won ton soup and the peking fried rice after dinner we got the requisite fortune cookie express yourself now what and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing all in all it was a good time at a pretty good chinese food restaurant
__label__1 the ambiance of this place is pretty great i made the comment while we were having diner that it would be a great place for a first date that way if it is awkward at least there is plenty to look at to make the time pass the food was pretty good for the price the service was also great id happily go back again
__label__1 both of the previous reviewers are correct actually yes there can be a line to the door at times and not everyone working there is 100 nice 100 of the time but who is and once you get to know them and are courageous enough to give them the benefit of the doubt everyone working there is very cool to deal with because this post office is tucked way back in the foothills its not staffed as heavily as ive seen some others but the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too seeing as this is too far out of the way for any nonfoothills residents so do like me never go here in a hurry be polite be patient its not all about you and youll see this is really no worse than any other post officeand maybe even a little bit better
__label__1 once again family was out to try something new i was in the mood for pizza i noticed there were quite a few pizza joint in this area so this was the first one we tried we order a pepperoni and green peppers pizza well done spaghetti and meatballs and chicken parmesan the pizza was good i enjoyed the flavors pepperoni cheese and sauce was very good i am not sold on the crust but overall the pizza was still good the spaghetti was very good especially the meatballs it takes a lot for me to like meatballs and these were one of the best i have tasted daughter hardly gave me a chance to taste the chicken parisian but what i did taste was really good they do like to pile on the cheese thats the way to get my daughters heart over all we had a great time we love the small mom and pops atmosphere and we will probably come back soon
__label__0 this is a some what conflicted review again i wish yelp would allow us to review multiple things the staff was extremely friendly maybe a tad too talkative the location was nice and clean the food looked great the pizza just wasnt that good its just way too sweet and when i say sweet its so extreme that it overshadows anything else about their pizza its so different in taste it makes it seem like the wrong sauce was used i know it wasnt if you dont like sweet sauce then order something else as their was nothing else remotely wrong with the rest of my dinner its just ive had about 1000 other better pizzas
__label__1 if only they have more fresh produce id stop by a lot more often
__label__1 ive been to this location a few times but this was by far the best experience ive had it was two sundays ago myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks my friend called ahead and made a reservation when we got there we had a big table reserved right in front of all the tvs our waitress was very attentive friendly and quick they had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games enjoying some beverages and eating some food their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and itll keep me coming back see ya next sunday majerles
__label__0 really if i could i would give this place zero stars because it is a disgrace if you need an emergency vet in the scottsdaleparadise valley area go to sonora veterinary specialists on cactus40th sthttpwwwsonoraveterinaryspecialistscom its also 247 but unlike vca pveah it is a truly valuable legitimate facility and its staffed by engaged committed deeply caring and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel at svs you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified vca is the opposite of svs in every single way vca is in fact the worst of corporate animal service providers the space is small cheap cramped and the staff are indifferent at best and dont convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress all they want is your money they do nothing for the 9975 they charge for an emergency exam we essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate literally nothing moreour dog was the exact same bloody traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him backafter making us wait nearly an hour without any communication furthermore they tack on bogus surcharges 525 for a biohazard waste fee that are irrelevant to the service provided and their drug prices are absurd8 for a single tramadol tablet anyone conversely our and our dogs experience at sonora veterinary specialists was wonderful even in the context of an emergency and the cost was ultimately significantly less vca is a moneygrubbing depressing sham
__label__1 a nonred meat eater walked into the kegthats how my story starts i am not known for making trips to a steakhouses but i have to say i like this place the staff are super friendly and are eager in helping you make a selection of drinks or food i highly recommend the strawberry lemonade supposedly theres gin in this drink but i did not taste a drop i tried the teriyaki chicken with a yummy pineapple cilantro salsa i chose the twice bake potato as my sideomg theres bacon it this was amazing and i need the recipe they dont have a bad happy hour menu i wont change my nonred meat eating ways but i will continue to visit the keg side note yes i eat bacon i dont eat red meat by choice and not for a cause
__label__1 super friendly staff and smoothies come out so fastdelicious too
__label__1 this place is excellent hands down the best tacos ive had fresh and flavorful meats and great salsas i see people raving about some of the salsa bars at all of the bertos and such but the salsa there is like water compared to what tacos atoyac has to offer they care about what they are serving and take pride in their craft if you like the style of food here you must try sonora mesquite grill on 46th street and thomas
__label__1 congratulations on opening the gilbert location glad to see you guys making the shift to the far east valley as to be expected the bruschetta was great we really enjoyed the syrah and the sangiovese its really hard to beat the 5 glasspitcher deal before 5pm and the board bottle 20 on monday and tuesday night make for the perfect date night though it can prove to create a long wait it was nice to see staff from the other locations making the move out here small mishaps and things that get confused in the midst of opening a new restaurant are bound to happen no worries though weve been 5 times in the first 10 days showing that you guys are right on target looking forward to getting to know the staff and becoming weekly regulars
__label__0 the ice cream floats were great i know because we ordered 5 of them the food on the other hand was not so good we ordered the kids cheese pizza grilled cheese sandwiches pastrami pastrami ruben and a cheese burger the pizza was not edible too hard for the price of the entrees it would have been nice to offer fries or fruit instead of chips or lower the price the staff was attentive and nice the atmosphere was great for playing i spy would visit again but only for soda and ice cream floats
__label__1 good chips and salsa excellent service friendly folks who greet you well and say goodbye when you leave my staff love this place and i gave them gift cards for xmas from here so they could go to lunch and talk about the boss food is good but not great not highend mexican but decent ingredients put together with care i highly recommend asking about their specials they are thinking about what they prepare and have some excellent dishes they have created themselves the spicy roast pork is very good as an example parking can be tough at peak hours i had to use the street last night and the place was absolutely packed large lot but at peak hours very good value you will leave knowing you have eaten something decor is basic mexican restaurant but comfortable
__label__1 if you need a hat this is where to go
__label__1 good little place in old town across from cowboy ciao had the turkey apple swiss wrap w dried cranberrieslocal greens smoked bacon and cashews very good and great size the lady had the grilled chicken sage pesto sandwich w goat cheese gala apple and smoked bacon she liked it as well the sweet potato chips were very good too will be back for sure
__label__1 ok here is the deal with red devil pizza the key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot that is why i like places with brick over pizzas they dont use brick ovens at red devil but i have been told that red devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get i cant verify that i dont even remember who told me that maybe i read it some where dont know if it is true or not what i do know is that red devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the valley their pizza is consistently good thincrisp and delicious i have had pastas and salads there as well they are fine nothing to get excited about but the pizza at red devil is something i will stake my reputation on actually i dont really have a reputation but if i did i would lay it on the line for red devil pizza the long and short of it is i am very passionate about their pizza period
__label__1 thai vietnamese a nice patio good happy hour and a swanky inside they have it all despite being a nicer place as asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value the happy hour menu has asian tappas apps for 5 and many 5 cocktails and glasses of wine we had the salmon satay which was just grilled cubes of salmon on a stick with sauce and some salad good but nothing special the veggie wontons were great in a brown sauce and filled with veggies and again a small salad garnish my cocktail was great but it was a bit strong for our mains we had the salmon with green curry it came in a huge bowl it was rich and full of great veggies and fresh not overcooked fish 1295 we also had the dragon noodles which was veggies tofu and glass noodles it was light and fresh 10 over all great quality value and patio i will be back
__label__1 they had kool aid i was so happy to see it the chicken and waffles were really good my girlfriend and i went straight there from the airport before going to our hotel and it was completely worth it yeah waiting outside in 100 degree heat isnt ideal but for 10 minutes you can deal with it especially when they had someone outside giving out water if youre ever in phoenix like us or live out there definitely stop in
__label__1 first time impressions are the most important and culinary dropout made an ever lasting one everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect the whole experience was so good that its hard to believe it will be the same when i go back i hope it is
__label__1 i booked this resort through priceline like so many other reviewers i had seen this resort from scottsdale road many times and always thought i would like to stay there sometime now i am so glad i finally got the chance we stayed for 2 nights over memorial day weekend upon check in i was asked if i would like to up grade to a king suite for 20 more a night i said sounds good to me i figured it couldnt hurt for as cheep as i got the room through priceline i cant say enough about how well we were treated at this resort some of the other reviews said that this resort didnt have a resort feel in my experience nothing could be further from the truth i was treated better here than i have been at many 5 star resorts that i have stayed at in the past our suite was part of a 4 plex of suites and while the decor was a little dated it was very plush and comfortable in every way from the couches to the king size bed the bathroom was very clean as was the entire room the ground around the entire resort were impeccable there are either 4 or 5 pools through out the resort and the main pool has a small waterfall the jacuzzi tubs were all very warm and in working order we didnt order room service but i did browse through the menu and the prices were really reasonable everyone we met that worked at the resort was extremely friendly with the exception of one bartender at the poolside cabana bar overall i would have rated the entire experience with 5 stars the reason i gave it only 4 stars is because of our experience at the poolside cabana on saturday afternoon we walked down to the poolside bar area to have a drink and we sat at a table near the bar we were ignored by the bartender for over 15 minutes while he talked to some young girl in a bikini who was already done getting her drinks when we were finally acknowledged we asked him if he knew how to make a certain drink he quickly replied no what else do you want in a very rude manner we each ordered some orange drink that was on special and it was terrible so i am taking a half star for that experience and a half star for the extremely high price of wifi it would have cost nearly 1300 a day so we decided to pass thank god for our smart phones overall we really loved our weekend at this resort and would definitely return especially for the great price we got through priceline although i never did get a chance to see a regular room and i wonder if our experience would have been as good if we hadnt upgraded to the suite
__label__1 i am a bonafide book junkie libraries are my mecca but im picky getting a spl card was a cinch i only needed one proof of residence although i brought the recommended three including a netflix envelope once i had my card i was ready to explore i headed first to the public computers that help you locate books yes with scraps of papers and minipencils handy i was good to go once i had selected a couple books to hunt down so far so good but then the library got tricky running out of the alphabet before i had found my book turning into another section from fiction to large print wtf i decided to turn this hunt into more of a tour so i wandered the aisles studied the names of sections and eventually reacquainted myself with the library system dont get me wrong this isnt rocket science its also not pop rocks having found my books and a couple dvds i proceeded to check out super easy too i can renew online bonus my first trip to the library was great then the second one came the library had none of the books i came looking for and i was prepared to find at least one of the books on my list of 5 nope so i put some on hold for me and wandered about very disappointed thats when i began to dislike this library none of my books really this library isnt browsingfriendly like others i have seen even the ol library in stillwater oklahoma was more comfortable than this one in fact i miss that ol library with its shelves of poetry psychology magazines and literature so easy to find so easy to browse so easy to sit for hours and read i couldnt leave spl fast enough on my way out a man working volunteering there showed me how to use the selfservice checkout system nice he was a friendly ol man who assumed i knew nothing about selfservice machines and probably doubted my ability to read for he explained stepbystep what i needed to do in order to check out my books at least the lesson was indepth enough for me to fully comprehend and then some so the next time i went to spl to pick up the books i had put on hold score i used the selfservice checkout i was in and out in like 746 minutes so lets recap slp has books slp doesnt always have the books you want sad face you can renew online create a profile and share reviews you can place books onhold from any computer if youre logged into your account people working there are friendly its easy to get a card just bring in your srp bill like i did its not an easy place to browse spl doesnt make you feel like you want to spend hours there there are private rooms just not sure how you reserve them there are monthly activities at the library but mostly about oldfart diets and how to use microsoft word theres free parking in the shade you can check your items out yourself with their selfservice checkout machine its pretty ugly inside brown biege dull and lifeless
__label__1 best place in scottsdale to watch a game great food greasy but what bar food isnt great drink specials and an even better atmosphere the owner came by and greeted us and made us feel very welcome i will definitely return in the future
__label__0 i was working in phoenix and was told that i had to try delux as they had the best burger and sweet potato fries i would ever have the fries were pretty good but i dont think they were anything above average the burger though i thought left a lot to be desired it was juicy but i would actually call it more greaseladen than truly juicy i like a moist burger but i dont want grease dripping off the bun that was my major problem that may be what some people like but i didnt
__label__0 i thought i was really in for one of the best burgers of my life due to my fellow yelpers reviews but was sort of disappointed i did like the fries in the shopping cart that was pretty creative but they werent anything special same way i felt about the delux burger the meat was dry and the condiments were lacking which made it worse i thiknk the bun was the best part i did do a cool beer flight which was nice the atmosphere is pretty neat here but i probably wont visit again if im in the area
__label__1 there are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices and not as loud but i had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening i go to ra scottsdale rd somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal miso soup yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing a california roll and four pieces of nigiri good stuff i usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference a few months ago i went to a different sushi place in tempe i paid with cash and when my change was returned the server had rounded up and treated himself to a presumptuous tip he didnt return my coins i called the manager over went home and wrote a bad review on yelp tell people not to go to that restaurant and wont return to eat there again this afternoon i sat at the sushi bar had excellent service good happy hour eats and good discussion with the young sushi chef i paid with cash and my ra server gave me back my change minus coins i immediately got tense and thought great here we go again i called her over to explain she said that she had roundedup in my favor i counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra she said that she didnt have coins so she just gave me the difference i thought that was very cool i thanked her and left a big tip now im writing about my good experience at ra sushi on scottsdale road and will definitely keep going there its amazing how one little gesture will have such ripples
__label__1 yummy worth the wait yes it is all the hype so get a drink enjoy the scenery and munch on some fabulous pizza not one thing i wouldnt order have fun and have a slice for me
__label__1 the food here is awesome every time i come here we have a great time and the waitress kimberly couldnt ask for better waitress
__label__1 met some friends here for happy hour the other day this is the old el paso bbq and they did a knockout job with the remodel great feel and warm colors to the place now i had a couple of coronas and some chips and guacamole the regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think ill try them the next time for lunch or dinner
__label__1 unfortunately my birthday always falls right around mothers day which means that every time i want to go out to eat for my birthday it is packed we thought wed celebrate early by going on saturday but it was still packed we called ahead and the earliest reservation was 9 pm but the person on the phone said that if we just came down they would fit us in so we sat at the bar for maybe 20 minutes in your face chain restaurants and our beers came with a small appetizer of cheese and salami these people think of everything and the wait staff is pretty damn attentive the hostess heard me say something about my birthday which was passed on to the waitress so my super huge and yummy meal ended with a delicious dessert of my choosing the bread and relish tray would have been more than enough of an appetizer for me but my partners in crime also wanted the spinach artichoke dip which was soooo tasty my steak was soft but cooked exactly how i like it these are true professionals asparagus was cooked perfectly the chicken pot pie soup was exactly what i expected and so yummy and the dessert triple creme brulee kahlua which tasted like a caucasian chocolate which managed to be super chocolately but not too rich and a mixed berry that would have been fabulous if i was a normal rasberry eating human yes its a little pricey but you easily get 2 meals if not more out of one dish especially with the yummy bread and relish tray that is also presented before the meal the atmosphere is cozy and a little crowded if you are wierd about personal space this is probably not the place to go overall i love this place and go every time i get the opportunity
__label__1 food was really good waitstaff were all really friendly and helpful in selecting drinks and entree would for sure go back
__label__1 my goodness this place has gone downhill yeesh
__label__1 one of my favorite places to eat if im looking for cheap and fast
__label__1 hubby and i have lived less than 5 miles from this place for over 20 years and never stopped in looking for good chinese so yelped the area and dragon palace popped up with good reviews comments about the outside are right little corner spot in dated strip mall but who cares if the food is goodand it was we ordered three lunches to try out different dishes both of us loved the egg rolls along with the sweet n sour chicken and the house chicken not as thrilled with the beef and brocolli nothing special on that dish so will stick with the chicken next timeand there will be a next time dont be fooled by the outside step in and try the food youll be back
__label__1 okayi have been going here for a while and i love the place and the food i am surprise it hasnt had as many reviews as it should the truth is i come back to support local businesses in my neighborhoodi would come here anyday than go to a fast food burger joint the trailor that the restaurant is in is the cutest thing you will ever seestraight out of a 50s picture its small but fitting the food is very freshi love their cheeseburgers and hotdogsi sometimes even get some of their mango salsachutney on the sidethey get it from this lady that homemakes it not the cleanliness place but i guess thats what makes it tastes so great its the extra greasei know that just sounds horrible but true anyways support locals and their businessesgo go go
__label__0 returned here after a years absense i understand they have had a change in management some for the better some for the worse new general manager and now the service seems much friendlyer and efficient new chef and now food is slow to arrive and not as good as it used to be steak was charred mashed potatos were lukewarm took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive hopefully it was just an off night for the kitchen but the general feel was that they lost the attention to the little details
__label__1 great atmosphere friendly staff and good food dined with a large group so we had a set menu i requested no butter with my crab stuffed chicken breast but they served it on the side just in case i felt the chicken was too dry it was delish
__label__0 empty tables told 15 minute wait ok 5 minutes into wait by the door bumping elbows with counter patrons 2 people at the counter complained they had been there 20 minutes we left at that point
__label__0 i went to this place after seeing a segment on diners driveins and dives food network i thought that the fusion of chinese mexican food would be good i was a bit disapointed the food was okay but nothing too special the establishment itself was clean and the service was quick so kudos to them for that
__label__1 hubbard family swim school has become a staple for our family you can feel the warmth and dedication on every visit our kids love it and are excited to come to every lesson we even have birthday parties here the instruction is topnotch and its evident while watching through the huge glass wall most of all my 5 year old is a much better swimmer than i am his father thanks to hubbard
__label__1 i love the artwork its a tiny little restaurant crammed with a bunch of little tables and chairs you go up to order at the counter theres a salsa bar in the corner with a lot of different salsas most are not that great they do bring you the food and you do get a basket of chips on the house the tacos are pretty heft about 3 bucks each they are gourmet tacos after all all in all its kind of uncomfortable servicerestaurant wise self serve but the tacos are very good and you do get chips and a variety of salsas not the most friendly staff and the cost is kind of high for a place like this but its pretty dang good get it to go if you dont mind packing a bunch of salsa cups
__label__1 best place in arcadia to get a coffee or a tea lots of friendly locals and great place to sit outside to people watch and read the paper in the morning early lunchtime
__label__1 everything about coronado cafe is charming and scrumptious its my goto place when i want to have a nice but not fussy lunch with a friend the menu has a lot of variety but not so much that its overwhelming ive never been disappointed by the food the raspberry iced tea is delicious too i like that they dont have any fried food though my male friends dont so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers conversations can be challenging when dining inside the acoustics in an old house arent the best to begin with and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy if you cant tune it out the patio is a really lovely alternative all in all you really cant go wrong here
__label__1 this is probably the sweet i crave the most salted butter caramel yummmm when i cant make it up to scottsdale i stop by my local whole foods in chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good
__label__1 the food wasnt phenomenal but it was very good the service was excellent the decor was very cool a good experience great selection of wines by the glass very pleasant experience
__label__1 ive lived near old town scottsdale for years and in all that time ive never really taken to the streets by foot aside from a weekly visit to the farmers market at first glance you ask yourself how many indian jewelry shops can the area possibly sustain well the answer is the turquoise market in old town seems to be doing quite well so it was on a recent exploration trip that we happened upon davids hamburgers and mexican food so for me the idea of killer burger and tasty mexican good is a match made in heaven were talking major food groups here tucked between 2 galleries davids is a blink and youll miss it kind of place very unassuming and humble inside you wont be wowed by the interior design but what they do have is functional and comfortable with tvs at both ends of the hall like space youll be entertained by performance videos of 50s era rock n roll i usually dont write much about soda pop well never but in this case the cherry coke 195 was kind of special when you order a coke you can ask them to add a number of different flavorings from lemon and vanilla to chocolate and of course cherry davids version is wonderfully fizzy and cuts through the richness of the upcoming meal of all the ways mexican style meat is prepared the grilled taste of beef is my all time favorite if you enjoy this as much as i do then id suggest the carne asada nachos 859 a massive pile of crunchy tortilla chips is covered in grilled beef strips melted cheese guacamole sour cream and pico de gallo while basic i ate most of them myself leaving my partner to scraping the cheese off of the plate if youd like salsa on your chips be sure to ask them to bring you bowls of green and red salsa now who doesnt like a big juicy hamburger davids doesnt disappoint with davids single 599 say that 2 times fast a 13lb patty topped with the usual suspects then dressed with davids creamy sauce which to me was a thick version of thousand isle dressing adding a layer of tangy goodness along side you have your choice of fries or you can choose to upgrade 99 to a mix of large deep fried onion rings and golden french fries for dipping i a side of davids sauce did the trick in lieu of ketchup the patty melt 725 is classic diner food were talking thick ground beef patty melted cheese and grilled onions on your choice of grilled sourdough or rye bread the wholesome grease from the beef patty and grilled onions is absorbed into the bread creating a creamy like texture for me this is what a patty melt is all about of course the guacamole burger 625 with its pepper jack cheese bacon and guacamole is the marriage of mexican and american influence if youre an early riser davids also serves breakfast like bacon pancakes 675 and coconut waffles 625 someone please pass the syrup my only question where is the breakfast burrito
__label__1 this is a great radio shack the staff are older and very knowledgeable with their product line if you need odd batteries check this store out first i needed a watch battery and found that they were the only store in phoenix to carry it it cost be all of 5 bucks but saved me having to buy a new watch
__label__1 these guys are still delivering consistenly good fresh food its a great little neighborhood place good food friendly owners just a really good place to go for a nice meal out nothing fancy clean restrooms always good limoncello after dinner always a hit
__label__1 was an interesting way to spend an hour lots of displays but very dusty on the inside of the cases quite and peaceful a nice place to hang out for awhile i showed up about 40 minutes before closing and she didnt charge me the 2 but i donated 3 since they operate only on donations the table set with rocks and minerals was fun to check out i would go back again when i wasnt short on time and explore upstairs
__label__1 trusted as a consistent friday hh or evening mealget together spot for a long time we have been a slave to the wingless buffalo dip the whole time we have been fortune enough have a great server mallory most of our visits as well she has never steered us wrong in food choices i have had the pizzas the sandwiches and even some special entrees it has all been good the reuben sandwich is a favorite and so is the sonoran burger the sweet potatoes fries are always really good side now some friends have had some bad experiences with service they have a hard time returning it happens esp when it is first friday or when the host staff is out of their minds there is just an inconsistency there but dont let that ruin the tone of the meal awesome patio parking can be a pain but sometimes you can park close around the corner great mix of people so good people watching too seating is tight at times because sometimes you are seated right next to another table where you can here each others convos can be fun at times def take all of our out of town guests here great hh spot
__label__1 i will be very briefthe food is fantastic the service is hard to figure out though lots of staff but we were constantly looking for our waiter the water guy the plate remover guy all seemed to be on break simultaneously i strongly recommend eating at the bar until they get the staff better trained
__label__1 i have used todd on at least a dozen occasions i am a property investor and i buy multiple homes i need todd for every house i do and he is always there for me he even got me into my own car once at the drop of a hat he is there for me his knowledge is excellent his demeanor is fantastic and his service and workmanship is excellent i would never use another locksmith unless he was dead or out of town in which case i would probably ask him to come home use this guy hes great
__label__1 im rather undecided about this place the hygienists are great and the staff is all very nice and accommodating every time i have to have a tooth filled yes im totally that person i feel like i have to go back because something is wrong for example not being able to floss between any of the filled teeth because the filling hasnt been filed down correctly i dont feel like the dentist really listens to you either when i felt like i had a problem with a tooth he told me it was fine and the next time i went back he found a huge cavity in that same tooth and told me i might need a root canal on it because it was so big what a pain
__label__1 this place has negra modelo on tap i would almost give them 4 stars alone for that the food here is incredible very reasonably priced and is mostly locally grown and raised add in there musical taste a mixture of latin and indie rock and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred i mean that in a good way we live in the east valley so this is a haul for us but this is the place we take our out of town guests everyone loves it
__label__1 just like the other yogurt places for selection good news they had a vegan type for those of you who care to be honest i ended up getting that one i am not vegan by any means but i do love a more icy texture and lessno creaminess when i have a cold dessert one negative is they are poorly staffed busy sunday afternoon and only one kid working there felt bad for the poor guy but i didnt feel bad for too long after as i mentioned to him that the mochi was bad and didnt really taste like it he said yeah its not the normal rainbow kind but this is what i call the albino mochi i tried not to laugh at that comment but yeah normal is his albino mochianyways dont get the mochi heresomething is soo off about it i cant put my finger on it its like an oopsie child between a marshmallow and albino mochi lol
__label__1 you know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood im one of those people but this time i teamed my seafood with steak they had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their new years eve dinner but i skipped over that i have to say i loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp shrimp was done correctly not rubbery or charred and gasp it was actually deveined i cant tell you how ive gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasnt deveined so that alone got a little happy dance from me food was a bit on the salty side but it didnt make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant server was friendly and knowledgeable which was great hubby ordered his prime rib but they didnt have it blue which was the way he wanted it its all good they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib ive seen in a long time for an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops i am a firm believer of bacon makes everything good and it did the sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful the fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me yet didnt make me feel like i was about to chip any teeth i cant wait to go back and try some of their other dishes
__label__1 my husbands former employer said when we get to phoenix we must go to innout he said the last time he had one there was a line out the door not much of a beef burger person we stumbled upon this burger joint as we left ikea and decided to try it the emergency granola bar i keep in my purse wasnt working there was no line out the door who wants to wait in line anyway we both ordered a cheeseburger no tomato no special sauce no ketchup for me it arrived in a card board container which was kinda cute and everything was hot and fresh my burger has a thick slice of onion and several crispy lettuce leaves the burger itself was just okay but the freshness of the toppings won me over my husbands had a big slice of tomato did innout live up to the hype from his former employer not exactly but it came pretty close
__label__1 wow been there 2 times i wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke and to my pleasant surprise it wasnt im from nw indiana originally i know corn indiana sweet corn cannot be beat well until i had the corn from americas taco shop this corn has cotija cheese hot sauce mayo and i swear crack there has to be crack in there i have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat i need that corn its just so good i dont eat beef and thats the only meat they serve but that wont stop me their vampiros minus the carne asada bean and cheese burritos chips and salsa quesadilla are all awesome they also have delicious horchata but that corn i know where im going tonight
__label__1 the best of the best i agree with daren c killer burgers steaks prime rib and of course ribs food melts in your mouth make this your next restaurant stop you will not be disappointed
__label__1 not bad i usually leave pretty happy and full
__label__1 pretty good place you never actually know who is your server because several different people actually wait on you the service can be slow at times which can get annoying the space is pretty big bigger than what it seems from the street the food was soso
__label__1 my wife and i ate here last night and were extremly happy we started with drinks at the bar which started the night out perfectlly then we had an appetizaer which was a tower of cheese a sculpture of grilled cheese like the hard grilled cheese on the sides of a grilled cheese sandwich i had the tacos they may be small but they were packed by taste my wife had the fish of the day and that day it was halibut my wife said it was the best fish she ever had the service was great overall a great smalll place to eat
__label__0 i wont be back here most cheap drive through fast food mexican places are alike of course there are slight differences in this case it wasnt for the better we had to drive up to the window to order the speaker box wasnt working what was going on there i ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream guacamole on the side the chimi was big just like i expected it to be there wasnt much guacamole i would have liked more they also put tomatoes in it thats ok im just mentioning it all in all this chimi just didnt sit as well as others ive had maybe it was the spices they used that were different im not sure i also ordered a large horchata i have definitely had better it wasnt the worst ive ever had but it needed more cinnamon flavor thats for sure its cheap its easy its fast its literally right down the street from me id still rather make the drive over to 7th st to my fave bertos though see httpwwwyelpcombizrolbertosphoenix
__label__1 while in phoenix for about 36 hours i lunched at hooters twice it was easily located across from my hotel and it was a weekend which meant i could catch both the collegiate and professional football games as well as playoff baseball i take hooters for what it is pretty decent fried food a restaurant that caters to men and always has a game on this in mind i didnt anticipate anything other then a beer and something to eat i sat at the bar both times and the bartender brittany was extremely friendly and made a point to learn while iding and remember everyones name which i thought was a nice touch she was always willing to change channels to make sure everyones game was being aired which was appreciated as well they have a good football special 10 boneless wings with all you can eat fries for 599 during any football game the 350 25oz shock top beers were a deal as well it was odd for me to see a kids birthday party in the restaurant on sunday but to each their own
__label__1 the florist manager is great but i have not had a great experience with the night manager he seemed upset that i was stopping him from tidying the shelves to ask about putting an order in for flowers he said he had no clue how to order flowers and could not help me i would need to come in and speak to the florist manager in the morning well i work and i wanted to order flowers as a surprise thats why i was there in the evening thought it was odd
__label__1 this was my 1st spring training baseball experience so i cant compare the ballpark with any other however as a newbie i can say that i appreciate the intimate setting every seat is a decent seat hubs and i had seat right behind home plate for less than 30 its a really chill atmosphere feels like a college ball park the concessions are priced fairly the bathrooms were clean i had a great time see you next year
__label__0 donuts are really good if they have any when you get there went in on a tuesday morning at 1030 and they only had a total of 10 donuts drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at dunkin donuts very disappointed
__label__1 only 4 stars because i have seen better nevertheless ajs is a great runner up to my personal favorite which is the thriving local business of portland or called new seasons if you have been to a new seasons you know that ajs is the close primo of find food grocers i will one day visit the the other ajs in town this place is a nice bike ride to from my house and has really nice employeesand the only place near me that sells kombucha relax and pleasant atmosphere like r
__label__1 i am basing this review solely on the cauliflower soup holy heaven in a cup we had zupas cater lunch at the office so i cant speak to the actual restaurant but man i wish i had a bucket of that soup
__label__1 its the kinda place where youre certain the employees dont spit in your food best taco bell ive been to
__label__1 absolutely incredible it appears the young lad who works here seems to be the goto frontdesk man everyday for this shop he was very helpful and told me exactly what my shoes needed and didnt suggest pricier repair options that my shoes really werent in need of i brought in two pairs of dress shoes one of which i had the heels replaced 22 free shining included and another just for shining 8 and they made them look nearbrand new again i will certainly be bringing all of my shoes in for repairscleaning within the near future to this fantastic little shop keep singing jerron
__label__1 this place needs a facelift the whole concept and decor is outdated and needs some help i think their sushi and other food items are alright although they try to be so trendy and in reality there menu is pretty blah its a fun place to grab a drink and sit on the patio but the excitement and trendiness of this place is completely gone
__label__1 sweet potato tater totswhy are you still reading what more needs to be said yum yum getcha some the only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their unwillingness to enforce rules with parents who bring kids and think everybody else wants to enjoy watching them run around the place like its a playground its not keep your kids at the table or at home
__label__1 i really like this place over pizza hut or dominoes because the pizza is excellent and well priced the pizza from here isnt gross like other pizza placeschains it tastes authentic and freshly made when we order pizza we only order from here we also get the wings usually we ask for extra sauce because if you dont they dont put much on them other than that its great it take anywhere from 2030 minutes for delivery for us
__label__1 my wife and i decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we were traveling with our 5month old so you can imagine we were a little apprehensive the resort is absolutely topnotch the rooms are very spacious the staff is very courteous and the facilities are simply superb our room overlooked the mountain and in the morning it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe the rooms have a microwave and a small fridge something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one the spa is simply one of the best in the valley and even if you dont stay here i would recommend the spa to anyone the resort is close to at least 20 golf courses something that might be important to other golf nuts like me so then why not 5 stars simply because they would not extend the checkout time for us by even an hour the checkout is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm so when i requested i was told very nicely but firmly that it wasnt going to happen ive traveled some and have never been turned down for a late checkout request ever still a great place to stay the facilities are topnotch the staff is very nice and we had a wonderful time would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing fun experience in the valley of the sun cheers
__label__1 sara bartender is the hottest chick in the world
__label__1 im working downtown now new themed list to come soon so im exploring the area from a different angle im no stranger to downtownmidtowns happy hour and dinner spots but ive never had to go out and search for breakfast or lunch during the day i checked out focaccia one morning when i hadnt had breakfast yet at the recommendation of my husband myles m who works right around the corner he said i should order the breakfast burrito so i did because hes pushy and i always do what im told ok neither of things are true but in this case he had conviction and i obediently complied the breakfast burrito was worth every penny being a somewhat recent convert to pescetarianism i got it with egg whites cool that they had that option spinach green salsa and potatoes the woman behind the counter made it up right there on the grill and it was warm and delicious the potatoes were skinon which gave them a great texture and flavor the eggs were perfectly cooked and the green salsa had a great kick the hot coffee from the carafe i got to accompany it was airplanequality but next time ill just grab something from cartel on the way back to my office god knows the burrito alone will be enough to keep me coming back to focaccia
__label__1 i can not believe that pizza could be this good i had good pizza on a recent trip to ny and this really is the closest that i can find to the pizza out there they say that its the water but i am skeptical of that i guess it doesnt matter what they did to make the pizza it was really really good
__label__1 i cant believe we get to review a free publication nonetheless its important to know especially for dave b who obviously didnt do his research that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine he decided this 17 years ago and despite pretty much breaking even it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no the ads do not cover the full cost continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness notice that the photoshoots use local designers local models local photographers and local locations the articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries businesses like restaurants and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means and about upandcoming events like the taco festival started by a local fashion shows again utilizing local designers and run by locals no dillards show coverage here and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community if the magazine doesnt seem critical enough its because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about and therefore dont have to waste pages with hateful criticism when java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer when its run by a local written by locals and put together in the publishers dining room i cant think of any magazine with more credibiilty and freedom the publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is thats why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the crescent ballroom thats also why youll read the backstory on five locally owned littleknown coffee houses at far ends of the valley the candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasnt been written about or to local artists designers or patrons of the arts while its always interesting to hear what people think of java knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month
__label__0 cheap cheap cheap everything here is disposable from the furniture to the linens to silverware silverware rusted after one cycle in the dishwasher so if you like to redecorate often and have a minimal budget this place is for you as far as their food ive only had a cinnamon roll here and it was stale bummer my biggest annoyance here are the people who seem to be beached out on all the couchesbedschairs dont you have homes
__label__1 first of all i have to give dos at least three stars just because its dos i mean did going to dos make me feel old yes were there some interesting people there and not in a good way yes did i spend more money than i wanted to yes but all in all you always have a great time nothin but laughs the giant jenga didnt suck either dos gringos is a staple among the youngins as i like to call em in college one will totally fit in however nowa days its a place meant solely for people watching and boy do you get an eye full drinks are cheap tacos are good and the bathrooms arent as scary as you would think go have fun get drunk but dont expect anything classy
__label__1 thank you sunflower for having a decent selection of tofu and fake meats so i dont have to drive 25 minutes to whole foods also i would like to tell you that i really enjoy your produce prices and your friendly staff especially the cashiers they are always so pleasant and helpful while i am at it i should probably apologize for sampling lots of your candy from the bulk item bins those chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels are amazing i promise i always use the scoop and one more thing its really awesome that you carry beers brewed by rinkukiu alaus darykla the lobster lover is delicious
__label__1 never had any complaints about this place except it smells like death when you walk in ive always been well taken care of when im here
__label__1 we absolutely love this place when we get out for date night this is where we go the waitstaff are great and the food is delicious i always have a hard time deciding what to get because we love it allfrom the fried okra to the jambalayaif youre in the area this place is definitely worth checking out
__label__1 wow i am very sorry that it took me so long to convince bri d to go here we went for brunch and it was amazing absolutely one of the best breakfasts i have ever had the johnny cakes were out of this world they have a granolay taste to them are filled with blueberries and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup it is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great despite being three pancakes they werent heavy and dense like normal ones they made me feel satisfied but not stuffed and gave me lots of energy throughout the day thats exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do i love this place it is beautiful inside i love their theme i love their concept and i love the food cant wait to try more
__label__1 this place has been my weakness since childhood i still get food from here once a month or so probably the only fast food place i visit often other than five guys when i lived on the east coast if youre preparing for a trip to mexico just dine here once a week for a month or two before your vacation youll probably be introduced to much of the bacteria of delicious realmexican street food perhaps its not that bad but it is delicious especially their pastrami dog you can be a selfproclaimed foodie all you want with your oh ha ha but i admit that i do on the occasion dine at the selected innout pompous asshole who thinks youre still downtoearth or you can come down and gorge on some real disgusting real fast food what are you afraid of your arteries will expand enough to still allow the blood through dont worry sure they may drop your hot dog on the ground and forget to use sanitary gloves from time to time but how else are you going to break in your immune system you sissy
__label__1 i love this place i can always spent all my money here on something they have great sales racks but also reasonable clothes not on sale too the atmosphere is always chill and the people working are super friendly also if you get bored of shopping for clothes they have random stuff like board games and books you can buy
__label__1 good food
__label__1 this is really worth taking the time to see and experience the cost is very low 5 per adult the garden is beautiful and peaceful with many areas where you can sit by yourself and reflect or just peoplewatch also the lady in the gift shop is very helpful if you are a first time visitor metro light rail stop at roosevelt and central

__label__1 this place was great well as great as a doctors visit can be they called us my son was the patient back within 5 minutes and immediately saw a doctor she was kind and took her time asked a lot of questions and did not hastily diagnose and fully explained to us what was going on with my sons health
__label__1 meh
__label__1 as a frequent antiques consumer i can honestly say that lizabels treasures is my favorite antique store in phoenix ive been a customer for several years and lizabels is my first and often only stop why lizabels is such a treasure is because of these things price desirable antiques and great customer service john and bette know what people want and they go to great lengths to get the antiques that people want and to make their customers happy im a believer they consistently have oneofakind quality furniture and pieces that you would not normally find elsewhere in town pieces are priced very agreeably so you can afford to stock up or furnish a whole room without busting the bank john and bette have created the kind of family business that is to be admired they have a legion of supportive customers and im one of them i can always find them to be helpful and interested in getting me what i want even if i dont always know what i want lisabels treasures is the place to build a relationship with because as ones lifes needs changes so does the need for different pieces and furniture i can always count on finding something i really love at their store and you will too

__label__0 i have ordered here before generals chicken and beef and broccoli but tonight we had the worst lo mein and coconut shrimp we ever had the lo mein was so bland and the coconut shrimp breading was so thick and untasty i cannot even identify what type of breading they used it actually ruined the sauce i would have rather ate the sauce alone with a spoon we didnt even save the leftovers i wont not order from her again but will make note of these two items do not order them
__label__0 staff is nice and thats it they use very cheap tires that only last for a year
__label__1 i love burgers and really wanted to love the grind but it wasnt meant to be unfortunately i had problems with the temperatures both the restaurant and the food i was here with my girlfriend on a tuesday night the restaurant itself is nicely appointed with a sleek modern look and feel it was pretty close to full but staff were still friendly and efficient the 5glass wine special they were running was very nice i has the peppercorn burger with sweet potato fritters the fritters were very nice crunch without being greasy and not overly sweet the burger was nicely composed with great toppings and flavors the watercress in particular stood out unfortunately the burger was also well well done and i had ordered medium i should have sent it back but was hungry and didnt want to wait for a burger joint missing a temperature on a burger is pretty disappointing and it killed a lot of the goodwill the rest of the ingredients had built up the bread pudding for desert wasnt the best ive ever had but was nice and the bourbon sauce it came with was a nice touch the other issue i had with the grind is the temp inside the restaurant ill grant that these are the dog days of summer right now and im sure its hard to keep the place cool with the half open kitchen but was pretty warm in there with the wine special it was ok value for the money i guess but on a normal night with 1012glass for wine and 10 for a burger with another 4 for fries its too pricey for my tastes especially if they arent hitting proper temps on the burgers every time
__label__0 i really wanted to like this place for starters i paid cash for my take out i was owed back five dollars and was told we dont have enough change so i had to settle for 250 what kind of restaurant doesnt have proper change especially on a saturday night the food chicken lettuce wraps had a strange fishy taste gave up on them after a few bites vegetable chow mein in my opinion a broun sauce is thick and flavorful this one was very liquidy and flavorless dumplings were edible at best do yourself a favor and stick with china chili
__label__1 best carne asada grilled sliced steak haciendastyle hospitality a mexican food experience in the themepark style colorful tasteful vibrant ambiance in the countryhacienda style kudos to the designers with an eye for detail dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above this place and the adjacent ranch market are a mustdo for tourists bring your outoftowners here dont miss the parrilla grilled platter one portion serves two choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference grilled vegetables include nopales cactus mexican zucchini squash jalapenos consumed whole took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled and baby onion stalks not the typical pileofajita yellows both rice and beans served family style and perfectly flavored i could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans juicy perfectly cooked shrimp asada goodness knows no bounds guacamole is plentiful no melonball scoops of yesterday at 3ea here and freshly made to order now thats what im talking about table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions really good burn try the horchata rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness or any of the featured aguas frescas no fuss over separate checks and that was for our table of 10 pork was a bit dry is gamey possible in pork server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes shucks they were sitting right there on the pass the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them togo after so many recent disappointments on rockhard rubbery shrimp i finally found a place that grills properly excellent marinade and with the freshest ingredients if you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands you are correct several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas cheese asada aguas and more if you dont have a filthyrich mexican relative with a hacienda mexican mansion across the border this may be the closest youll get without an invitation the mostlyabandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market bodas or other festival in the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala the grand room dont miss the ranch market next door you wont see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town take your camera
__label__1 the pizza is just ok pretty crowded at lunch time and seating is a nightmare get the lunch special you get a personal pizza slicer and a pan would get it to go if i didnt live in the west valley good idea to have a separate take out door but dont count on this place to be acceptable for those of us with disabilities to get around
__label__1 i was so excited to visit the new postino in gilbert i love and frequent the original but this new location is much closer to my house bruschetta is amazing love the atmosphere and staff too wine selection rocks great happy hour prices highly recommend a visit
__label__1 as someone who loves thai food i can really appreciate a good pad thai and wild thaigers is my favorite hands down just like the menu says their pad thai has a plethora of intense flavors to the point where every bite is unique if you love pad thai and havent tried wild thaigers you need to if you dont love pad thai its probably because you havent tried wild thaigers seriously this is one of the best dishes ive found in phoenix their other dishes are consistently good as well i love chicken satay but most places only offer it as an appetizer with a few skimpy chicken strips wild thaiger on the other hand has a filling peanut chicken lunch as well as a peanut passion dinner both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner but if youre going for lunch you may want to consider thai basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras their thai tea is strong yet creamy just like it should be and you can even add boba to it a must if youre eating anything spicy the service is very professional and timely the atmosphere is pretty classy in fact its probably the nicestlooking thai restaurant ive been to its also the only thai restaurant i can think of with a patio all in all it has a very welcoming atmosphere i would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as i would a tshirt and jeans its a great place for dates business lunches or just some great takeout you might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints but the quality more than makes up for it i would say the prices are spoton one day ill learn how to write a review thats short and sweet but i kept thinking of good things to say about this place highly recommended
__label__0 not only was the music the worst i have ever heard the wait staff was as annoying as ever like a wanna be swanky place in a strip mall that smells like fish and plays horrible music food was so so but over priced for what it was
__label__1 the pool area was very nice every chair had a towel on it ready for you the pool service was great greg badger is the most hardworking waiter there he was out in the sun in upper 90lower 100 degree temperatures and was very helpful to all the guests i ate at elements the other times i visited arizona but the poolside menu is great too i preferred the orange chicken bento box although edamame was not on the poolside menu our waiter was able to get it for us that is great service the bed was very comfortable nice and soft i also liked the wallmounted flatscreen lcd tvthe valet service was great as well we were greeted everytime we drove into the sanctuary complex the tennis courts were very nice as well i played during the morning and made use of their ball machine to warm up
__label__1 great mexican food authentic street tacos plus a full menu of tasty dishes halibut tacos remind me of ensenada michelada with pacifico beer is a perfect beverage for any dish
__label__1 ive seen this place come up on yelp a lot especially since its near where i work and finally had a chance to take jon s out for a sort of going away dinner the other night i thought to make reservations which was a good idea because it was very packed on a friday night we started with the taste of thai which is their version of a pupu platter my favorites were the thai toast and chicken satay it was a little weird that the fried items were hot but the pot stickers and siamese kisses were a little warm but still good i had the crispy basil chicken level 3 hot and jon had the shrimp stirfry level 1 hot when our dishes were brought out we both loved the flavors but agreed we needed some more heat and our server gladly brought out some chili paste for us which did the job its a very cute restaurant and ill definitely be back to try some other things on the menu
__label__1 i really like this place alot their pizzas are really different but really good i wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection major thumbs up
__label__1 go for the food and you wont be disappointed great middle eastern dishes served up nice and generously whether you get it to go or for dining in i went here and ate in and there was initially no one in the restaurant but me and then it quickly filled up with people so i know that this is a neighborhood spot the gyros and tzatziki sauce are very good but so is the hummus falafel kibbi and shwarma
__label__1 took my family here for dinner the hamburgers were really good i had the regular charburger and i liked it quite a bit it was better than most of the fast food chains but id rank it below the higher end burgers from places like fuddruckers or red robin for the price though i was very satisfied my 8 year old really liked her charburger with cheese but my other daughters did not like the grilled cheese at all i was not impressed by either the regular or sweet potato fries but the onion rings were good we did not get any dessert although the sundaes and milk shakes looked really appealing well try those next time
__label__1 best pizza in the valley that ive had ive yet to do pizzaria banco great service always made fast and great pricingdoenst travel well so if youre gonna have it in your car for a while i wouldnt recommend iti think thats why theres a lot of soggy crust comments etc
__label__0 why meh the state of repair on the games made this a voyage of discovery eg with a 2 hour unlimited card i could work out which machines actually worked id rather have a downed machine than something that is unplayable but maybe im just unlucky that i hit the 45 games with issues in my first plays end ghost recon gun on left wont hold steady target jumps all over opposite of it need for speed carbon has a intermittent brake pedal which wont let the car go too fast mechwarrior 4 beachhead 2000 unit hideously slow jumping frames jerking hydraulics broke after playing cant get 8 way direction on left side of tekken 5 gave up and played galaga after that yeah left right fire that works variety is lacklustre shoot drive and oh shoot and drive is about all you get with rare fighting games not a single vertical horizontal scroller
__label__1 i love cheuvronts and have been going there regularly for years why only three stars then over the past year and a half the service has gone downhill i find that the servers are impersonal and rigid and sometimes a little pompous after three or four bad experiences in a row i just dont go there anymore they do have great cheese plates and a fantastic happy hourjust dont catch them when they have a special event going on
__label__1 neat this place is like a trip to a nonpetting zoo and aquarium and aviary while you dine on fairly decent mexican food i was here for a late brunch and didnt wait at all i was near a window that right on the pond and just about every turtle in the pond crawled out to come on over and see what the rock was cooking and how i was enjoying it no joke see pic the ducks and geese were very active in the lagoon showing off for all the diners and it thrilled the kids to pieces the guacamole is decent and the 3 types of salsa youre given were all good in their own ways if anything swing in here for the atmosphere i bet its awesome at night
__label__1 as a frequent traveler into scottsdale i was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball playerwho happens to be my nephew we were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by mastros which consistently has excellent food michael dominick opened dominicks lincoln avenue prime steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small but excellent scottsdale quarter ill admit to frequenting this nike store in travels to phoenix the ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse the rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers very opulent without being ostentatious we both ordered the bonein filet which is an excellent aged prime cut supposedly according to our very professional server this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving my limit on steak is typical 68 ounces and i ate my entire meal making me think 1 this place really is that good and 2 i doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving we started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest we minimized the veggies ordered ill go back during baseball season after ordering a glass of of the extensive but reasonably priced wine list we looked at dinner entree the steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces the house rub was described as cajunstyle but not overwhelming my theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat but take away from great cuts hence i went no sauce the result was an incredibly great dinner of bonein filets ordered medium rare no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side this side comes preprepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese chives bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table we finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert excellent steak spot and a welcome highend addition to the scottsdale food scene one comment the branding of the restaurant is confusing either call it dominicks or lincoln avenue but not both this actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty youd want to keep and associate qualifier im not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion i would love to see mastros try a southwest cuisine spot
__label__1 decent wash generally pretty quick used to be octopus car wash has lube and detail center although i have never used that service one of the better wash places way better than dannys for sure
__label__0 the rap on starbucks is that they overroast or incinerate their beans and i think that might be rightsometimes at starbucks it seems like im drinking something brewed from charcoal briquettesit doesnt taste good now i will tell you that i am really no connoisseur of coffeesi like coffee you knowa good dark roast made with freshly roasted beans but the beans dont have to come from a specific plant grown on the southern side of a special hill in columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort no i just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price why cant starbucks do that i occasionally need to meet someone for business and starbucks comes up as meeting place and i understand thatthey are almost annoyingly ubiquitous i have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in san francisco having a cup of coffee at a starbuckslooking at the starbucks across the streetlewis black calls it the place where space and time folds in on itselfi say why build the hadron super collider to open a black holestarbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a starbucks for every adult in the united states in and of itself thats no reason for a 2 star reviewgordon gecko said it bestgreed is good and starbucks exemplifies that credothey are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the bay area defectors from peets coffeei have no problem with success no my gripe with starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the producttheir coffee is crap so is most of the stuff they serveits second or third rate at best and just because its convenient doesnt mean we all need to stop in there is better coffee and better tea and better everything aroundat much better pricesits worth looking for another meeting spot
__label__0 i was going to take the time to write a scathing review but i honestly cant even bring myself to do it 1 star thats all i can say
__label__0 i recently had a shit cleaned at the intercontinental hotel in hong kong not cheap i only mention that because this place charged more to clean that suit almost 30 for a twopiece suit after they tacked on their 6 designer brand surcharge no i am not kidding despite branding as green the suit still reeked of solvent the green silicabased solvents have never left an odor in my experience no differentiation to justify these absurd prices a lot of good alternatives in the area be warned
__label__1 if you appreciate a good dive bar you will love this place we came here for the first time when our team was playing in glendale dos gringos played host to all bcs fans and it was a blast they have giant jenga dancing multiple levels bars and a great outdoor space the facilities are a little beat definitely a place where you dont want to touch anything in the bathroom at least when it is packed the bar staff does a good job of managing the crowd and i never felt like i was wasting time begging for them to ask me what i wanted we returned for a bachelorette party and although we still had a good time i think this place really thrives when you are with a huge group food is decent but not why you come here
__label__1 my wife and i visited lgo a while back and we were both impressed and enjoyed our meal the wings were by far the best i have ever tasted our pizza was great we had the pepperoni and ricotta it does get kinda crowded and chaotic on weekend nights the grocery store in pretty cool but didnt buy anything like a previous review it did feel like a upscale cracker barrel all around a great place to eat also take a camera so you can take pictures of all the lame hipster clowns that try to make it all about them they are the only downside to lgo
__label__1 i moved in here a few ago and i do like it for the most part the grounds are kept clean and tidy except for some irresponsible pet owners some of them even let their pets run around leashless or cannot control them but that is not the managements issue pros 1 the apts are spacious wellbuilt 2 grounds are clean and grass is maintained 3 pool is wellmaintained 4 online system for rent pay and maintenance tickets is great 5 price is great for the value cons 1 apts not soundproof or heatproof 2 sprinklers tend to sprinkle more water over the sidewalks than the grass area 3 covered parking is extra and not enough of them anyways 4 uncovered spots are all just crowded in the parking lot at the back 5 security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides 6 outer compound walls are not high enough to actually preventmake it difficult for an intruder 7 fitness center is adequate at best most of the free weights and equipment except the machines are broken or missing the machines work ok but are not maintained well 8 leasing office employees could use a bit more smile and interpersonal skills
__label__1 whenever i start leaning toward being a vegetarian like my daughter is i remember the smell and taste of that scrumptious meltinyourmouth filet mignon at durants and the hot fudge sundae for dessert dang just cant beat it the bartenders are old schoolnot too aloof not fawning just professional and classy the best
__label__0 try as i might i cannot give this place a thumbsup ive likely been in de 30 times over the last 10 years always wanting to give them another chance they are closeby and the food is above average but the service always sucks i seriously wonder if the servers are trained to ignore customers im not referring to when it is busy im talking weeknights with a very light crowd they all must be independently wealthy is the only thing i can guess
__label__1 dropped by for lunch with 90yr old and 2 yr old plus hubby all in all very good hubby had sausage samich wfries he really enjoyed it baby had spaghetti and meatball she ate real good which means it was real good mom had catfish wspaghetti and marinara she ate more than half and the rest went home with her i had chicken marsala wmarinara on ziti i subbed the wedding soup for the salad the service was very quick and attentive the lamb appetizer was just right with the bread everything was tasty and very nice presentation will be back soon very convenient very reasonable prices plus a full bar for happy hour pizza looked very promising too take out may also be in my future relationship with lil deemos
__label__1 mmmmm mmmmmm great food the popcorn shrimp here are to die forthey leave a wonderful lasting impression so does their desert platethe service was wonderful and quick and attending to us also we had been lounging at the pool all day and were not looking so sharp but they didnt seem to have a dress code or anything as they were more than welcoming it is a bit pricey but im not sure you can expect anything less when going to a w hotel i recommend this place to anyone who wants a more chic sushi experience cool atmosphere doesnt mind paying the extra dollar and enjoys tasty food
__label__0 let me preface this review i have lived in this area for 15 years and chompies has been the only option for good jewish deli in my 51 years i have never received worse service than from chompies they always get the order wrong tonight after much debate i caved for my daughter who has strep throat she wanted nothing else but matzah ball soup to make her feel better so reluctantly i called in for take out at chompies i assumed the one thing on there menu that might be a safe bet and hard to screw up would be the soup i returned home and called my daughter in to tell her i got what the doctor ordered as i watched her pour it in the bowl we noticed it was missing one key ingredient the soup when i decided to call and tell chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order this was more than screwing up a order this was forgetting the soup in soup they told me if i wanted the broth i should have asked for it in a separate container i responded i didnt think i had to ask for broth in soup i will never give them a dime of my money again i highly recommend to drive the additional 1520 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food you will be highly disappointed with chompies this is the first time i have ever heard of yelp my son told me to come on here because this is a way to tell other people to avoid restaurants such as these i hope you take my advice
__label__1 been here twice and enjoyed both of our experiences the setting is pretty urban feeling for far east mesagrateful for that the wine list is pretty unusuallots of wines and grapes youve never heard of since the owner is fromhungary cant remember but the wine selection benefits from his extensive knowledge of that region the fried chickenpatented no lesswas really something spicy and brined to fall off the bone the pasta dishes are good as well with portions expected in a urban restaurant dont expect claim jumper portions all in all a great place to sit savor dinner and talk waitstaff is on a learning curve and you benefit since the restaurant is new and they bend over backwards servicewise highly recommended
__label__0 for my hubby and i on a saturday night grimaldis turned out to be pretty lame the restaurant is decorated well and the hostess was friendly enough but the actual pizza was sooooo boring i seriously took a bite and wondered if i had missed the slice altogether i will say i tasted a lot of garlic but that doesnt count for much when the pepporoni is bland and the sauce is useless now im a deepdish girl at heart but ive had amazing thin slice at classic italian pizza in tempe this place made me feel like i wasted my money and i woudnt ever want to bring anyone here including myself again
__label__1 great iced tea terrific roast beef and mashed potatoes love the biscuits you cant go wrong at cracker barrel
__label__1 i love greek food i have no idea when i became so enamored with greek cuisine but i am glad i did i end up craving it at least once or twice a week so when i met the fiance for lunch today near his office i mentioned aforementioned craving and he led us here to cyprus grill the place was pleasantly busy but not overcrowded we ordered at the counter and out food came out pretty quickly we tried the gyro pita as well as the gyro plate we cleared our plates in no time so i guess that means the food was good right the gyro meat was tasty moist and flavorful the rice was delicious and the tzatziki sauce was refreshing we decided that wed be going back for future lunch dates whenever possible besides you cant have too many go to greek spots in my opinion so this ones definitely going in our books done and done
__label__1 orange table is one of my goto spots in the valley the food and atmosphere are superb the wide assortment of beverages certainly strengthens ots menu when pairing food and drink i will admit that while the location may seem hard to find there are times where ive had to wait and waitbut if you enjoy great food then it is worth the wait their salads and burgers especially the wine burger w cheese and red onion are fantastic

__label__1 i had an awesome experience here and highly recommend dr dachs he is here to be a good dentist not just to get rich his hygienist was a rock star so nice and very gentle i nearly fell asleep during the cleaning i found my way to this practice after a horrible experience at another dentist just half a mile away see my review of belmont dentistry on raintree dr dachs was just so helpful and reassuring while still maintaining a very high level of professionalism i am very thankful that my second opinion quest led me to him i now finally have a topquality dentist in scottsdale i can trust i definitely recommend selecting this practice it may take a little time to get in but its worth it they also work well with insurance
__label__1 my wife wanted to go here a few weeks back for her birthday so we went on a saturday afternoon parking was easy to find and there was no wait to get a table wish it had been a touch cooler but it wasnt so we decided to eat indoors had a little snafu with our servers where someone who was not our waiter took our drink orders but it was straightened out pretty quickly we each ordered one of the signature drinks the wife got cucumber lemonade i think and i got a green arnold palmer i liked the gap for the meal dont remember what the wife had i got the chicken sausage pizza it was fine nothing out of the ordinary basically thats how the whole meal was okay but didnt blow me away not that im a huge healthyorganic foodie kind of guy though i guess id go here again but i probably wouldnt suggest it i did think the music was a little loud
__label__1 sadly received this email today sabatinos is closed you know we have been experiencing a lack of sales which we can blame on the economy new restaurants opening here in the valley most likely for much less cost than us original places we tried to work with our landlord but he would not budge on lowering our rent we just could not afford the 550000 this month and were afraid we would lose everything in our place to a lockout which was threatened to us already we just wanted to say goodbye to all of our loyal customers we really enjoyed having you come in weekly and keeping up with your lives as well as you keeping up with ours we will probably be leaving the az area and starting over fresh god bless kevin and sheri
__label__1 i mostly buy mountian house and other camping foods from rei they have a huge selection to choose from including biscuits and gravy dont expect 5 star restraunt food but on those long days at a military range mountain house beats the pants off mres not to mention you could eat 3 mountain house meals and be about where a mre is ive been drooling over several other items at the store id like to go backpacking sometime and they have tons of little things that could make things a little more tolerable for either military operations or camping backpacking
__label__1 this review is for the bar only first time i came in here it was packed to this gills and no where to sit so we left next second time i came here i met 2 of the strangest old women ive ever encountered who tried to reel me into a marketing scam wouldnt shut up about how lovely i was and how both of them wanted me as their daughter then performed reiki on me and my friend waving their hands all around us eyes closed and chanting in front of the everyone i couldnt help but bust out in laughter bartender laughed too then poured more bourbon in my glass and winked i really liked this place aside from the geriatric nonsense great vibe i loved the entrance you walk right through the kitchen and can observe the chefs working their magic the interior is dark and sexy with some of the coolest wallpaper ive ever seen i am hoping to write an update soon because i desperately want to try the steak that i have heard so much about but 60 for dinner is a little out of my budget thanks to our economical crisis and being unemployed sigh
__label__1 love love love the ambience outside love the fact the restaurant is in a old style bungalow and the patio is lit with string lights i went there for the first time last night 15min before close and i dont know if they usually have music or notbut if they dont they need it food was great but nothing to die for
__label__0 mucho gusto es mucho mierda let me say first that the place is cute the staff is friendly and the salsa is good there im not being a total jerk the food however left much to be desired i couldnt find much to like about my chicken tacos they were ok but the meat didnt have much flavor there was no cheese and they were pretty stingy with the guacamole and pico what really got me was that they didnt come with rice and beans instead i got a lovely pile of cheap bagged romaine coated in some sort of caesarish dressing sure there were a few cubes of cheese and a tomato slice a slice on top but come on 14 for a couple of naked tacos and a pile of romaine for that much they could have at least picked the white core parts of the lettuce out of my salad or i dunno sprinkled a little cheese on the tacos the story was much the same with the fish tacos only the salad was different the enchiladas seemed to be a hit and those are served with rice and beans the vegan at the table ordered a side of rice and beans for her meal and they arent kidding about it being a side i think my cats food bowl is bigger they charge 1 per bowl if you want more chips i know 1 isnt a big deal but its just the principle i already felt ripped off from the entree so the extra charge for the chips just made it worse needless to say i wont be going back there are far better choices closer to home
__label__1 i dont know why i waited so long to visit yogurtology its located conveniently next to my safeway why did i wait so long yogurtology has perfected selfserve froyo the flavors are spotonlemon meringue birthday cake nsa coffee peach mango tart cheesecake mango rootbeerthe list goes oni always end up getting oatmeal cookie its made inhouse with real oatmeal cookies were talking oatmeal cookie literally in the froyo none of that artificial flavor crap it is incredible instead of having little placards for the flavors there are digital sony tv screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional rundown very hightech the selection of toppings is unparalleledbaklava three different kinds of twix and milky way brownie chocolate chip cookie bar chocolate covered waffle cone premium fruit and nutsanything you can imagine yogurtology has it not only that but the shop is impeccably clean and the staff are consistently cheerful this place blows yogurtland and yogurtopia and all other yogurtology locations out of the water this is where you want to go
__label__1 my daughter and i really love it here i always walk in without an appointment and i never have to wait more than a few minutes the staff is very friendly talented and professional highly recommended
__label__1 panda garden is a family run chinese food restaurant that is always friendly and most importantly delicious you can order dishes family style and theres plenty of delicious meals to try my personal favorite is the empress chicken sweeter then orange chicken but the flavor just melts in your mouth i just had the kung pao two which is chicken and shrimp and its even better the next day as leftovers thanks to the generous portions they have a good selection of sake and beer as well this is my favorite chinese restaurant and hope everyone else checks it out
__label__1 we had a restaurantcom coupon they also have happy hour specials on appetizers you cannot combine specials with the coupon we started with edamame and mussels i have never had mussels before just oysters and clams the mussels were effin awesome they were not super chewy and the way they were seasoned and served spicy and bold was seriously amazing three of us polished off three different rolls spicy tuna crunch roll over the top what the heck roll another spicy roll that was seriously good as h ll screaming roll spicy tempura style shrimp roll with a delicious crunch spicy is the way to go with sushi rolls for dessert we went with mochi ice cream served in four flavors vanilla strawberry green tea and mango the green tea and mango were my favorites such a good dinner now if only they served alcohol
__label__1 the place was just your typical stable but my wife and i had a wonderful experience here it was our first time riding so the staff took great care to show us how to mount and maneuver the horses we then followed a guide through an orchard for an hours ride just the right length of time for us as beginners the horses were very tame and were easy to ride the best part of the experience however was our interaction with the staff they couldnt have been more friendly and more helpful were excited to go back
__label__1 pretty good place separate bar area upstairs with lots of tvs for sports nice size portions a little pricey but big portions
__label__1 very tasty had the pork which it typically dry but here it was really good the only thing is that i got bored with the flavor quality of ingredients are very high
__label__1 the sign also bills itself as santa fe style food having lived many years in new mexico with a family generations of which are from new mexico the cuisine was decidely not new mexican it was standard sonoran with that said the meal was quite enjoyable the enchilada sauce had a nice flavor the dulce de leche was fantastic the service was very good the decor was a little nondescript but thats ok all in all a nice addition to the meager choices for mexican food in surprise we would probably come back i had to give it 3stars because of what it is not if you are looking for spanish food there is none here if you are looking for new mexican stylecuisine you wont find it either however if you are looking for a decent enjoyable meal at a local familyowned establishment this is a good choice
__label__0 if im rating strictly on getting what i wanted out of the visit this doctor is fine he checked my eyes did all of the tests and i walked out with my prescription here is why i cant give him a good review and this is solely based on my personality and preferences while dealing with the service industry others may think hes wonderful 1 i purposely chose an early morning 730 am appointment so that i would get to work by 9 my office is less than a mile from his office and i was still running into work at 905 am this is due to the very longwinded soapbox like speech that dr greene gave me i am a getin getout type of person who hates small talk and hates selfpromotion even more and if i heard him tell me how often he visits the gym or works out one more time i probably would have gauged my eyes out right there to never need an optometrist again i also learned all about his wife friends boatyou name ithe told me about it completely unsolicited 2 i am an educated individual who does not need an hourlong explanation filled with graphical references and cutesy anecdotes about why i now need progressive lenses 3 the fearinducing sales pitch by the staff and the doctor was a bit much i realize that all optometrists and dentists are going this route now buy this test not covered by insurance and be free from worry that youll instantly go blind however if i want something ill ask for itjust like any other retailer like i saidi got what i needed a solid eye exam and prescription however i purposely did not buy glasses there due to the doctors cheesy personality and the hardsell environment again there are obviously based on the other posters people who are attracted to this type of personalityi am not one of them hence why i do most of my shopping online
__label__1 i love this place great food great service from some of the nicest staff and just a fun place to go it is also a place i like to meet people for happy hour they have a wonderful selection of beers fantastic wines and i have never once had anything but great food while eating there
__label__0 the thing about cpk ive noticed over the years if you want adequate service show up when its not busy because when it is busy plan on paying full price for drinks and meals that are completely and utterly lackluster cpk do me a solid if you run out of garnish for your 750 sangrias let me know i really look forward to that soaked pineapple and cherry thank you very much and please dont think of it as audacious for me to request a dollar off for your mistake bottom line wont return and wont recommend this to anyone i love or even just moderately like
__label__1 i love pizzaametro and so does joe arpaio i am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common this is where i take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while i kid i kid i have never had anything here that i dont find super delicious and craveworthy the first time i went here my party was personally doted on by maurizio who was overthetop gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing while i dont see him every time i am here the service never suffers the calamari is crisp and light which is a nice change from heavy fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many italian joints hands down my favorite item on the menu is the frescolina the combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it so next time you are at pizzaametro my advice is dont loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is joe arpaio dont look him up on your blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners dont bring up that his mother died in childbirth and how that potentially explains a great deal of the mans politics no matter how much wine you have had do not forget how small this restaurant is because in the end after he and his bodyguards leave the server will tell you yeah that was him
__label__1 i came to timo for my birthday last week after hearing rave reviews about it from a few friends of mine i met up with the fabulous jennifer t and i was so happy to check this place out i like any place that i get to walk in through a back door i passed through the very chill looking patio area first another plus in my book plenty of outdoor seating that looked dangerously inviting once this hot hot heat cools off inside was intimate but with the large windows it wasnt dark and depressing like your own little happy wine bar world they have an amazing wood burning oven normally that itself is plenty good enough but then theres the food that comes out of that wonderful oven i only tried the spinach and artichoke dip which was the best i have ever had it didnt have a pool of oil first time for everything it was so fresh and i really appreciated seeing the bread sliced fresh right in front of us since we were sitting at the bar i saw several other things flatbread come out of that oven and i will have to go back to try them everything smelled delicious and was presented with a touch of class without being pretentious i was also very intrigued by the eggplant dip which is apparently better than baba now for the drinks holy cow ive been drinking a few years now so safe to say ive tried many many drinks or so i thought coconut mojito anyone made with ciroc coconut vodka as tasty as mojitos are i dont get a long well with rum so vodka was a pleasant surprise and the coconut just brought the mmmmmazing factor to a whole new level i also tried the white sangria another 5 stars great wine list too apothic red is one of a few reds i like and they have it the staff was top notch as well i arrived shortly before a shift change and both bartenders were personable and hard working and truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing im pretty bad with names unfortunately or i would love to mention them i cant wait to go back for drinks and food i think id even go alone for lunch if i didnt have any company

__label__0 surprised this place isnt closed by now went here once when i first started going to asu and never came back their ingredients are not fresh gyro meat tastes old and decrepit they really need to hire better pita makers who dont resemble drug addicts and derelicts my pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me literally by the time i got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating
__label__0 this safeway is nice and is close to my house but after visiting this weekend i have to stay i am going to stick with bashas the prices are definitely higher on my normal items at safeway also i know safeway cant really control this but the vibe is not as friendly the parking lot was packed there were grumpy folks looking for spots this is the same safeway that my husband was at when a guy and his girlfriend walked up to him and offered him 5 to help get him a hair cut my husbands hair wasnt even that long maybe an inch or two i dont know what it is that draws that type of crowd but bashas has a much more hometown feel
__label__1 unique place that you wouldnt stop at unless you were recommended seriously this isnt the type of place you drive by and say oh lets stop there word of mouth is what im guessing drives this business we were recommended to visit this place by the entertainer for the evening a belly dancer efes isnt your typical sitdown restaurant in fact you may have to kneel down the environment is to set a casual turkish dinner setting if you have a big party some of you may be sitting on the floordont worry there are plenty of pillows the entertainment was good if you like belly dancing and the music was interesting our party of 4 opted for the super sampler to start and the efes mix to share i personally like this type of food exotic full of spices not your typical meats my wife didnt necessarily find it great but ate some and didnt complain i think the doner kabob was the best if you go with a group the efes mix was a great way to try a little of everything and was plenty of food for our party of 4
__label__1 i recently attended a conference in az and stayed at the squaw peak the grounds were very nice and with all the onsite activities this hotel would be quite a draw for the kids being i dont have any kids plus it was too cold to be out by the pool activities on site were pretty limited the gym facilities and the comfort of the bed made up for the lack of adult festivities the gym was good sized and had ample new equipment the bed was really comfortable and had great pillows great for a family vacation aok for the business traveler
__label__1 my family has been going to dr brittan for 10 years he is an excellent dentist and can handle any situation you can throw at him
__label__0 well laid out zoospace good for animalsmore for kids than adults zoo had limited number of animalswho were boredlistlesshiding mostly water ponds for animals were stagnant with algae all in all not a great experience they are going to expand it seemsbut they should pay more attention to the animals they have celtcharm
__label__1 all around great great food great atmosphere and great location if you work in the downtown area
__label__1 i had a really great experience at the havana cafe everybody there was super nice and the service was great i dont think our water glasses ever got to less than 12 full the food was excellent pricewise it was a little more than we expected but totally worth it the sangria and drinks were kind of pricey but ah well overall a very good experience we will be back
__label__1 we had a group dinner in one of their private rooms the wine room which as decent obviously wines all around us but a nice room for a group of 10 anyways the food we had was amazing be sure to try the the appetizer drunken bread cabrales fonduta white wine garlic herbs for my entree i had the rigatoncini w sweet spicy schreiners lamb sausage heirloom legumes local greens charred tomatoes chili pecorino it was perfect with a nice kick to it definitely recommend it and for dessertprado sundae house made vanilla gelato apple wood bacon caramelized bananas amarone cherries warm chocolate sauce roasted almonds whip cream biscotti crumble amazing my first bacon dessert and it was worth it also try the dulce de leche bread pudding bourbon caramel sauce vanilla anglaise chantilly cream and get yourself a mojito while you are there surprisingly good of course this is the main restaurant at the montelucia resort so expect hotel pricing the menus are also seasonal so my recommendations now might be completely different when you go there
__label__1 first just be careful of sitting on the planters on the north side of the building if you have to wait for a table sometimes you might get surprised by ants now if that didnt scare you away and i was trying a little because i am hoping to tamp down the wait time a scoche please enjoy yourself postinos arcadia location is the original forerunner in the revitalization of the phoenix scene postino cleverly located in a former post office thanks usps if you find yourself here with a wait not always but sometimes look about yourself the patrons at this location are uber friendly with a largerthanaverage number of regulars some of them have very good stories to share and are particularly generous we waited one night and had two gentlemen with a high top table offer to let us share their space it was a rousing good time full of mutual ease and they left before our party of 3 had finished when we went to pay we found out they had taken care of the entire bill thanks guys its that kinda place a little magical a little homey a little bit of wonderful with great food and plentiful draughts and just enough contemporary edge that you can impress a date or drink with the dudes

__label__0 ive lived at mark taylor properties for about five or six years now and i have to say they have declined greatly in the last few years when i first started living at my first mt property the front office staff took the time to get to know you knew you by name kept abreast of any ongoing issues and were proactive about things now they really seem to be nothing more than shills for what mark taylor has become reacting to issues only when implored to do so rent constantly goes up even for those of us that have shown property loyalty years over additional fees are even being added on for services that you may or may not even use either way you have to pay the only reason that i didnt give them one star is because of the maintenance staff they are what the front office staff used to be friendly polite and very responsive to your problems they in fact have a pretty similar opinion of the front office folks as i do that is pretty telling
__label__1 oh rhythm room how i adore thee i have seen some of the greatest blues legends play here and have never been disappointed whenever the rhythm room allstars play i definitely try to make it they are rockin i dig the dancing the bbq mmmmmm and i enjoy when the fck the police guy is roller skating on the dance floor i do recommend getting there early if you want a table and a chair for bands i really want to see i get there before they open get in line get a table then someone in my party goes to grab us some bbq and we start drinking and eating and waiting for the music to start i always have a great time here and now that you cant smoke its even better

__label__1 ive been looking for a decent prime rib in the area for years with no luck thats all changed now i found lafittes on yelp and was surprised i had no idea it existed im glad i came though the prime rib was easily the best prime rib ive had in this part of town and may be the best prime rib ive had in the under 20 price range in years the place seems relatively unknown its hidden in the embassy suites hotel so on a saturday night it was pretty slow hardly anyone there thats really a shame the food was very good it started with the salad it seemed fresh it didnt look or feel like it came from a bag the greens werent overly cold or wet and it was arranged nicely on the plate the bread was a simple sourdough we ordered the petite cut and when our waitress brought out the plate i was a bit shocked it was much larger than everyone elses large cut i could barely eat it thats saying something i had the creaole jambalaya as a side it was tasty with some spice the sausage was tasty the vegetables were ok a mix of squash colored onions etc the waitress was friendly and courteous and never let our drinks get empty the nest part was that two of us ate for less than 35 ill be back
__label__1 flemings is always top notch we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for 25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass the selection was good from lite whites to deep reds a great way to sample a portion of there new wine list then to top it off we received 25 gift cards for dinner so we stayed and had the az resturant week pre fix dinner for 39 the food was wonderful salads soup lamb chops and filet i guess to sum it up you cant go wrong with a meal from flemings they also have a great happy hour

__label__1 always wanted to stop by and give them a try only thing that stopped me were some bad rumors of how clean they are but then again how clean is all the places we eat at so i had their 8 meat ball sandwich this was my second choice i wanted was their cheese steak but they were out of cheeses steak but i do not regret their meat ball sandwich it was very good wish their bread would have been more toasted but i thought it was good anyways place looks like and feels like a lot like subway but i do agree they do add more meat to the sandwich i will probably come back again
__label__1 great fruit and vegetables bulk items like nuts and cranberries are a good value check out the meat and deli cage free chicken and grass fed beef salmon and tuna are fresh they do have some good values here the cashiers are good and give the nickel bag discount
__label__0 its unfortunate their menu only has 4 sandwiches on it the food was good albeit leaves a lot to wish for it came on a plate with a couple olives and nothing else i would expect more for the 911 price tag they market themselves as a sandwich shop but i just dont buy it more so it was a hipster hangout where it seems people go to look cool granted the few items the did have were quite good but i just expected a nice turkey sandwich but that wasnt happening the service was on the verge of incompetent but the owner did swing by with a loaf of bread too bad we had to ask for oil at the counter to dip it in our waitress was absent their water was unpalatable and they didnt have a lemon lime orange or anything wedge to make it slightly less offensive my friends that live in phoenix told me though this is just the way it is there all in all i certainly wont be rushing back but there is plenty of room for positive improvements
__label__1 the only big asian market in all of phoenix which is shockingly enough located in the chinese community center they have live fish and every canned good you can think of want some canned unagi no problem rice cooker that doesnt suck gotem some frozen shrimp balls win theyre panasian everything and if they dont have it youre hosed this is the only game in town
__label__0 yikesi wont be going back the ordering system is confusing the staff also seemed confused the food was very bland and pretty tasteless this place is not even in the same league as honey bears near the airport skip this bland chain and go to honey bears
__label__1 ok ok i know i said i would never bring my clothes here ever again i was having a rather busy week so i told my dad to drop my clothes off to the cleaners i thought he was going to take my stuff over to continental where i usually go but he brought everything to seville i was a little upset but being the angel of a son that i am i bit the bullet and smiled i thanked him for helping me out when it came time to pick up my clothes i carefully walked in knowing i slammed them in my past review and quietly picked up my clothes i got home and noticed that one of my shirts had not been cleaned properly there was a stain on it from what i think was cola later that day i drove back to seville and they offered to clean it once more flash forward to the next pickup day the stain was still there i asked for a manager and it happened to be someone that seemed to be the owner he asked how much i paid for the shirt they gave me a check for the full amount its very rare that i write a review update that spans a few stars only defalcos comes to mind but seville took my crappy situation and made it right i was very hesitant in coming back the first time around and it was only because i was forced to im glad everything worked out the way it did not because i got a new shirt out of it but because i got a better experience way to step up your game seville ill be back if im in the area
__label__0 wish i could rate negative stars with so many bar choices this place is by far the worst last saturday a group of friends went out for a friends birthday celebration in scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at loco patron it was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early we finished our last call drinks and started to head out the friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom at this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave my friend started to explain his reason for not leaving friends still in bathroom but was quickly cut off i watched from the patio as the two bouncers both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out as he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him the bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment pinned him down with their elbows and hit him at this point i had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him i had already taken out my phone to call 911 and i quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force we demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request he swiped my friends phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive the police arrived and took down the bouncers information and stated that they would be recording this incident i am absolutely adamant in saying that neither i nor my friends will ever frequent loco patron again we were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening non physical patrons of their establishment based on the behavior of the two bouncers i assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves what i witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and i plan on writing any regulatory agency i can think of these people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law
__label__1 finally another downtown lunch option im viewing this as the inbetween place inbetween arrogant butchers heavy on the lawyer heavy on the political scene diners and inbetween celtichooters i mean tilted kilt upstairs the food menu is interesting a lot of appetizers not enough salads for my taste compared to arrogant butcher and likely tilted kilt the menu has less salads and less fried foods but itll be hard to find something healthy to eat it veers towards the comfort food side with options like chili with cornbread souffle and flatbreads served with burrata fondue there are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza the day i went the lunch room was busy you enter in through the a lobby shared with stand up live didnt get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection will have to try that out the next time im here for a show the management and service is very friendly not in a scary way just in a i really want to enjoy your experience way this is in sharp contrast to the service at lucky strike across the way which ive found to be downright rude at times keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to do well
__label__1 the time was 430am it was dark and a little chilly with the sun not yet up perhaps thats why they call it black friday but my money was on the delicate hint of malice in the air as i stood shoulder to shoulder with veteran soccer moms with steel and fire glinting from their eyes scowling teenagers and college students bubbling with nervous energy and the occasional henpecked dad who got talked into dealing with shopping insanity as some sort of a special treat before trudging off to the salt mines for the day there were at least five hundred infantry ahead of me and five hundred behind me and our numbers kept growing there were scattered bits of conversation but most of us were silent contemplating the chaos we were about to charge into for the sake of our families our friends our lovers but mostly for the sake of savings we glanced ahead and behind sizing up the competition mentally calculating our strategies for navigating the battlefield we were at least a battalion strong perhaps a regiment by the time the doors would open and it would be every man woman and child for themselves occasionally someone would open a wallet or a purse checking and rechecking their ammunition occasionally running a finger along the edge of a bank card or bill to make sure they maintained their razor edge slowly we began to march forward and the slow but steady trudge was a stark contrast to the sense of frantic urgency that crackled in the morning air not all of us could walk away victors but all of us were determined to try then something happened something i would have never expected as we approached the double glass doors we were greeted by another army with their bright blue uniforms they could have been un peacekeepers they handed us each a large plastic bag and ushered us into the store with bleary eyed smiles the fear and tension started to lift i have been at toys r us on christmas eve i have seen the very worst of holiday spirits and i was ready to face them again all for the sake of an censored that censored just had to have yes the store was crowded but there were so many helpful indeed cheerful sales attendants on hand that most of us shoppers just melted into a gentle wave of requests which were quickly and cheerfully met before anyone could get bent out of shape or stressed out a sales clerk simply asked me to wait for a moment while she located a reserve ticket for the doorbuster item i had stood in line for one minute and fifteen seconds later she returned with a document which guaranteed me my desired item at the desired price to be delivered to me as i left the store another clerk helped me locate the other items i needed and i was done with my shopping within ten minutes of course it took another hour or so to work through the serpentine line at the checkout but all of us were so relieved at how painless and indeed bloodless the shopping experience had been we were more than happy to stand in line waiting for the opportunity to plunk down our hard earned cash on the latest objects of technolust that had caught the eyes of our loved ones we left tired and we left poor but i dare say most of us left happy and for that best buy and the entire best buy army have my eternal gratitude thanks for taking the ass out of christm
__label__1 i really expected crappy food because after all thats what sports bars generally offer then i was told that the food was not bad but good which only made me eye my table mates suspiciously i ordered the tacos al carbon which comes with cilantro lime rice these are three street taco sized dealies that have steak in them and come with a little shot of pico and queso now like i said i expected crap but the tacos with pico and queso poured on them and grease dribbling out into a glorious puddle on the plate were really amazingly good the steak bits were really tenderordinarily in such a taco theyd be the tenderness of jerky really the tacos were totally sensational also we ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread which is essentially a pizza and it was great even with the bleu cheese which i detest this was a culinary delight so why the four stars you ask two reasons one the cilantro lime rice is offensively bad like straight out of a box of ricearoni bad i would have preferred kibbles and bits as a side item and one other thing it was happy hour and for a while they were serving beer out of pitchers that were in the refrigerator instead of straight out of the tap capital crime felonious in fact dante wrote about a circle of hell where all they did was serve beer out of pitchers instead of straight from the tap so you should know that although the beer serving would usually be a four star deduction and id never look back i didnt drink beer tonight and so i really dont care if my table mates suffer but if you try that shit on me four stars the food is really damn good
__label__1 i love this second location in the royal coffee series as much as the one at the market since its summer i thought i should mention that the iced coffee is so smooth and amazing that you dont even have to add anything to it dont believe me ask for a sample next time you are here and i guarantee you will be astounded a quiet and chill atmosphere if you want to workstudyread as well as a great place for delicious grab n go coffee in the biltmore area
__label__1 my man took me to fuego for a prebirthday meal on a wednesday night i was surprised to see how many diners were there a because its a wednesday and b because its in such an odd spot once you get past the randomness of its location you will see how quaint and homey feeling it is the two servers working the front of the house were friendly multitaskers who welcomed advised and fetched drinks while we decided on then waited for our meal we started with the scallop app and agreed that it was great although small 3 scallops13 how bout one more tasty morsel apparently it was small to save room for the hulking entrees we graciously received next wow i had the seared ahia huge portion of it spicily seasoned lightly seared and great tasting the man had the stuffed chicken breast and inhaled it it looked great as well also in the great category were the side dishes omg the cheddar massed potatoes were so freaking scrumptious i could die i also had the jalapeño creamed corn that i mixed with the potatoes to make a combo from heaven man got the green chile cornbread casserole which sounded meh but tasted incredible such a fantastic meal stuffed with amazing food and pampered by attentive servers i was disappointed that i couldnt give fuego 5 stars but it wouldnt be prudent why you ask because the sangria sucked i had both the white that tasted like watered down koolaid and the red that tasted like old cheap red wine mixed with coke a cola they both sucked not good hopefully it was an off night beveragewise and i just happened to be there for it everything else was spoton
__label__1 okay since my latest review i was contacted by the manager who expressed concern on my bad experience fran wanted to make sure they had the opportunity to make it right i was impressed i do want to say that even if the food sometimes needs a little sumptin sumptin the customer service is great and always has been i give them superb credit for that the ambiance is nice too we went back for another try we were satisfied i definitely think you should stick with the thin or traditional crust it was better also a note to update a previous review they no longer have the portobello steak sticks not sure why maybe a cost thing but they were delicious and i will miss them another cool note that should be said because it cant be said about most places with an outdoor patio they do not allow smoking in the patio dining area which is such a refreshing change its nice to be able to enjoy the great arizona weather this time of year thanks for that final words boombozz is on the top of our list again
__label__1 i come here at least 3 or 4 times a month best asian food in phoenix however it is now closed
__label__0 i found this place on yelp and went there for the lunch buffet having read the reviews i had really high expectations of the place but was sorely disappointed watery sambar and rasam hard idlis dosas with a miserly amount of potato stuffing gulab jamuns that tasted nothing like gulab jamuns inattentive and too few waiters and disgustingly dirty bathroomsin my opinion udupi cafe missed the mark completely their a la carte menu items might be better but i am not going back to find out
__label__1 wings are not my favorite type of food and i find most wing bars to be about the same so when the east valley friday night evfn tweetup headed here i didnt have high hopes the wings were good the beer was even better i was honestly impressed by the excellent selection on tap including some crazy stuff i had never head of before it satisfies both the pickiest vegetarian and pickiest beer snob i know so is on my list of places to take just about anyone to relax and have a good time
__label__1 yelpers prove to be right yet again with the average 3 stars on this one i was craving sushi and had a hot date with my sisterinlaw last night to do dinner and a movie it just so happened that eat pray love was playing at the tempe marketplace harkins theater so we decided to meet at kabuki before the movie i walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two i as told 10 or 15 minutes not so bad so i decided to wait i walked outside and met up with my alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later as we did so two other women came in and i saw that they were seated right away i looked at alexa looked up at the hostess stand was thinking wtf and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list there are two tables before you i was told it will likely be another ten minutes or so at that i responded is there another option perhaps sushi bar that i dont know about and alas there sure was they neglected to give me that option when i originally checkedin we were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal heres why while the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat i prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat service our waiter wasnt the friendliest i felt kind of rushed by him when we were there additionally since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables which was very distracting while we were eating perhaps they couldve moved the sushi ready for pickup to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future the sushi itself was good not amazing we had a sunset roll a lotus roll a large roll and an order of ikura i didnt realize the lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked lobster that came on top of it it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking to top things off when the bill came they overcharged us a simple mistake but given our experience it was just one more negative thing and then when i pointed it out i barely got an apology at all with so many other restaurants to choose from in the tempe marketplace i am not sure ill return to kabuki if i do however i will wait for a regular table
__label__1 today was our first time eating here so armed with great reviews from other yelpers we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu daily from 4307p and shared a pasta entree of the apps we had toasted ravioli a platter of antipasti and by recommendation from our lovely server amber the stuffed eggplant the toasted ravioli was deliciouscrispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana melty cheese on the inside a dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off the antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters but for me and my spouse it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers the stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey cheesy goodness and marinara sauce this was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers but after a taste he started sneaking bites while i wasnt looking i added some chili flakes for a little heat but it was very flavorful im not a huge melted cheese lover and wouldve preferred a little less cheese but it was perfect for my husband the restaurant wasnt super busy when we arrived at 6pm but by the time we left around 8pm the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85 filled the prices were higher than what we normally spend but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour so it wasnt that bad at all our bill came out to about 17 without tip and we didnt order drinks you do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials but we didnt mind well be back
__label__1 when sen ken cheuvront opened this restaurant i was living in midtown phoenix and it was at a time when a lot of restaurants in the area didnt exist i was beyond excited of its creation its a very trendy urban feel with a nice patio on central avenue located at the bottom of artisan condos its not a terribly easy place to see if youre driving by they feature an incredible selection of wines and cheeses of which you can purchase and take home as well as nosh in the restaurant they also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night a particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork they are definitely delicious also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops there is nothing here that is oddly unique but everything is interesting and it is a nice spot to hang out with friends and have a nice night out especially during a first friday
__label__1 their food isnt bad its pretty hard to mess up gyros rice salad and fries when it comes to this type of food it really comes down to preference for me i didnt care for this place i like crispy fries their fries are soggy i like beef lamb gyros theirs are beef only i like a mixed green salad with light onion they serve a shredded romaine salad with heavy onion their prices are fair portions large and service friendly its just not for me they did have a lot of sandwiches and burgers that looked good if thats your thing
__label__1 i loved it the salad bar is not so great but everything else is excellent
__label__1 first time here and it was really good i ordered the bobbie sandwich since i hear everyone raving about it it was ok not my favorite place is really clean and wasnt busy at all for lunch around 1130 i like going to a place where i can get in and get out staff was really friendly they gave me this punch card buy 10 get the 11th free very nice about the same prices as subway so i wasnt upset plus the sizes of food are definitely moneys worth at least i think for anyone in the chandler area this is definitely a place to stop in and try
__label__1 i have been to ra a handful of times for happy hour and was always annoyed by the loud music and crowd however this time i went here for happy hour as a first stop for a bachelorette party and i had a great time the upbeat social atmosphere was great for getting the night started the group ordered a ton of appetizers and rolls and even a drink each and we walked out at about 30 a piece the elderberry mixed drink was especially good normally i do not pick this place for sushi happy hour because i dont like their quality of sushi and like quieter placed to relax with a friend or two but if your going for a fun group atmosphere this place is perfect but only during happy hour otherwise it is definitely not worth the price
__label__1 delux makes good burgers but you probably figured that out already they also have good fries sweet and regular potato thank you very much they are kinda expensive if i have to compare it to something i would compare it to california pizza kitchen better than a regular pizza but probably not worth the cost
__label__0 i decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local great clips i called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top the lady assured me that they did i was leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like madonna half way through this butchering she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut kid you not it was an inch longer at the sides than the center i looked like a cross between the gunny and flock of seagulls i went home set the clippers on 3 and finished the jobwould not go back here unless i lost a bet
__label__1 after the padres spring training game we had reservations at don charlies in scottsdale none of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad as soon as you walk into don and charlies your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts i especially like the cactus league beer list which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the cactus league colorado coors light texas shiner bock chicago old style and san diego stone ipa etc also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated i had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great i wasnt thrilled with the side dish potatos au gratin which is a 250 upcharge they also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw we were too full for dessert and as we walked out this place was packed i found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat willie mays himself he was signing his book or a baseball for a 200 charitable donation to his foundation needless to say i m not bringing home any memorabilia myself
__label__1 so yummy my favorite mexican place love the chips salsa and bean dip the extra spicy green salsa is so good too we are regulars here

__label__1 if you need any office supplies furniture printers computers or one of them fancy electronic book readers then you should check this place out not being a teacher or office manageremployee i only come to these stores for printer ink i was greeted with a friendly hello can i help you find something by one of the employees my friend was looking for a stapler which the employee quickly guided us down the aisle to find an extensive collection although i didnt see a red swingline stapler there is a huge print service station in the back and plenty of employees to help out with anything check out was super quick as there were three cashiers open and ready for a customer oh and i found out thanks to my teacher friend that you get a discount if you are a teacher pretty rad
__label__1 i found this little hot spot on yelp and used my phone to navigate me there i wouldnt have found it otherwise this small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of historic downtown chandler its a quaint little diner with modest décor i felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly as i looked over the menu the first thing i saw was the morning monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients cheddar isnt better its all about havarti folks i neednt look further i knew thats what i was having hawaiian bread french toast bacon turkey egg and the havarti absolutely delicious cant wait to come back and bring everyone i know
__label__1 my husband and i went there for lunch today and because of vegegirly cs review about the deep fried pickles guess what we ordered omg they were amazing we ordered the cajun style and man oh man were they goooooood we have never even heard of them but i am so glad we got them so crispy and so hot mmmmm and 12 priced we got greeted and seated quickly i ordered the chicken brie sandwhich and my husband had the meatloaf sandwhich i am not sure where the comment about small portions came from because they were good sized and we were both stuffed the only change to the chicken brie would be to have the pears sliced thinner rather than having thick pears to bite through otherwise it was yummy i also ordered the arizona iced tea for the first time since they didnt have fresh mint to make my mojito i was pleasantly surprised at how light and refreshing it was we had the entertainment card which they didnt punch so we can use it again and we will
__label__1 pretty good mexican grub in the 480 i had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate the meat in the tacos was tender tasty and plentiful accompanied by chilantro onion and hot sauce typical ingredients but done right the chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce the batter was not too soggy the chile was cooked well not crunchyunderdone not squishyovercooked and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into this dish came with the standard rice and beans neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form minus two big stars for what they consider guacamole it wasnt thick it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish no bueno if it aint green thick and tasty you better hit the drawing board ya feel me
__label__1 i love that they are kid friendly and that chef aaron came by to ask how everything was delicious food
__label__1 love it wish we still lived in arizona as chino is the one thing we miss every time i think about chino bandido my mouth starts watering if i am ever in the state again i will drive out of my way just to go to it again yummy
__label__1 like red robin carrabas is my goto italian joint that i know i wont be disappointed in i love their bread and the yummy oilherbs that go with it i do ask for butter as well but they always seem to bring out this frozen ball of butter i dont get that the best dish they have is their pollo rosa maria it consists of two chicken breasts stuff with fontina cheese and covered with a huge helping of sauteed mushrooms make sure to get it with fettuccine alfredo its a must if you dont like pasta i dont know what to tel ya the combo of the two is a match made in heaven they have great salads and their own special house dressing heads up on your ranch lovers they do not have ranch dressing as for their deserts im not much of a fan until they have their quarterly creme brulet good food
__label__0 when i bought my house my realtor recommended these guys for the termite inspection they found a couple shelter tubes old inactive so i paid them to treat the house and bought a 2 year warranty included in the warranty is a free annual inspection and any followup treatments necessary sounded good first the good part the treatment appears to have worked just fine as i have not seen any new evidence of creepy crawlies munching mi casa thats good for three stars i suppose but heres where i have a gripe last fall 1 yr in to the new house it occurred to me in passing that id been here a year and that i should be expecting some sort of contact from the termite people to schedule the annual inspection a call a letter something saying hey youre due i dont think this is unreasonable to expect from a serviceoriented company shoot its been well over a decade since i bought my car and the original dealership still sends me letters saying hey youre due for your 150k service i hear nothing and pretty much forget about it until another year goes by i receive a letter from them hey your warranty is up for renewal i dont recall if the first letter contains paraphrased by the way wed love to schedule your free annual inspection or if that came in the 2nd letter or the 1st or 2nd call or maybe it was the 3rd letter and the 3rd call it certainly was in the hey your warranty lapsed but if you respond right away well reinstate it for you and schedule your free annual inspection letter though which frankly irritates me a lot i will not be renewing my warranty with this company as my experience has shown that id be paying for nothing summary treatment fine it was effective i have no more signs of bugs service awful theyll ignore you unless they want money from you warranty im not saying its a scam but um i certainly did not receive any value for the money i paid them
__label__1 i know i might some flack for only giving this place 3 stars but reallyits no different than changs if i could give half stars i would give it a 35 why because i think its better than changs its exactly the same menu just not as diverse but cheaper if you are at this location try totts instead i bet youll start going there more often than here
__label__1 johnnies garbage dog is the work of the gods you cant go wrong with any of the dogs here so when you cant make up your mind and everything looks so good why not just have it all seriously try this one be forewarned it can be messy so get a good grip because once you pick it up you wont be able to put it down
__label__0 not impressed loud atmosphere bland overpriced sandwiches 10 employees behind the counter and no clean tables how many people does it take to make a sandwich more like the employees are just here to hang out with each other than work
__label__0 i know i know its phoenix but i expected something far better perhaps my mistake located in what looks like an old fast food location this is a no frills no cart and no nonsense dim sum experience dont think i will be going back for many reasons but if you are craving some bao or need a dumpling fix this place will do just dont expect much
__label__1 love love love this place
__label__1 because sometimes you just want to flip the bird at calorie counting and healthy living this valley landmark is the place for satisfying that once in awhile sinful urge to screw up your carefully laid out dietary plans
__label__1 i love this outdoor mall its clean its open and has a wonderful restaurant selection it doesnt have a huge amount of stores but the stores it does have fits the bill now that it has j crew life got a little sweeter i really miss the border book store however some cool biltmore activities are yoga in the park and movies in the park the movies are usually classics and happen during the fall another bonus is its super dog friendly if you have a four legged friend to walk around with make sure you walk to the east end of the mall and visit arizona humane societys petique to visit the other pups happy shopping
__label__1 this is the best place if you want to escape arizona and feel a bit of wine country best place to spend a sunday afternoon my favorite part is uncorking a bottle of wine and ordering lunch to be eaten outdoors so spring weather is the best buy a mini loaf of bread and try their delicious olive oils and spreadssuper inexpensive appetizer at just 150 and the samples are free they offer many sandwiches and the waffles with berries are to die for looking forward to trying their pizzaon my next visit regardless of what you choose follow up with gellattoyum or take home some olive oil cupcakes delicious and moistbut a little spendy
__label__1 this cafe provided me with my first ethiopian cuisine experience it was delicious and i am eager to go back the most impressive thing to me was their selection of vegetarian dishes they had as many options as those with meat which i really appreciate doesnt happen very often the service was great you can tell this is a family run restaurant that cares about their patrons the food is very reasonably priced which make it easy to try a variety of dishes we started with the shorba which is a lentil based soup this was probably my favorite part of the meal it was absolutely delicioussatisfying and hearty we also had the vegetable combination which had 5 different dishes served on the injera a crepelike bread you eat the main dishes with this is a fun way to eat with your hands and opened up a new world of foods for us cant wait to go back and devour a bowl of shorba
__label__1 i cant believe i didnt write a review of metro after my first visit but i got a second chance last saturday night with dottsy z andrea k and company we had a reservation for 8pm for 4 of us and at 730pm andrea asked us to add 2 guests and when dottsy called metro they said of course but please be advised you may have a little wait for the larger table which leads me to the only bad point of the evening we had to wait one and a half hours for our larger table we had all expected and accepted a 30 minute wait after about 40 we went to the bar to get some wine and oysters otter creeks yummmm after an hour had passed and no one had come to address the situation with our group i approached the hostess and she was very apologetic and offered to comp our bar tab which was incredibly nice when we were finally seated our server was friendly and attentive and had gorgeous blue eyes hello we were all starving and got right to the point with our orders i started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me a cold soup this is made with cucumbers buttermilk dill and olive oil with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top because why the hell not also the soup came in a really large bowl and i was full by the time i finished it i did soldier on to my main course which was the moules frites which is what i had the first time i came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels and a broth with thyme garlic and perhaps a little white wine then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didnt leave oil on my hands sadly i had to leave some of those friends behind but only because it was time for dessert i chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche i requested a briochefree pot and it was no problem i was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrupcreme and three slices of caramelized banana it was really yummy though within 10 minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar i will point out that this dinner took 2 full hours we left at 1130pm making this the longest i ever spent in a restaurant 35 hours are you kidding me which is why i ultimately docked one star based on food alone metro brasserie deserves 10 stars
__label__1 im so in love with this place i tried the pepperoni pizza and i was amazed i love that they have a fresh herbvegetable garden in the front its all about the fresh ingredients these days i cant wait to go back and try different dishes id like to try the cheese platters mouth watering as we speak going again to day so ill keep adding to this review stay tuned btw the decor reminds me of the vig but definitely more spacious dining area
__label__1 this is a cool venue to catch a show i actually played a show here and it was good times they have a large dance floor or an area where people can gather to watch performers they also have a nice sized bar which can handle a good sized crowd we all know that is a must when it comes getting a drink in a crowed venue i really enjoyed this spot and had a fun time rocking peoples face off
__label__1 had lunch here with 6 coworkers and the server accomodated 5 seperate checks with no fuss she quickly brought out two baskets of soft warm bread that looked handmade along with pouring out balsamic vinegar and light olive oil for dipping the server described the days special but we all ended up ordering eight inch pizzas a lunch only size i had bacon and chose to have it cooked in the optional brick oven for 1 extra not sure why they offer it seperately but exp at other places made me like the way it cooks better than reg oven it wasnt much to go on but the food was good the service friendly and efficient and the everything was clean and neat recommended if youre in the area
__label__1 as a vegetarian and sporadic health nut i just love tjs they have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce including my beloved broccolini for 40 of what safeway charges huge selection of frozen veggiefriendly dinners good for my onthego household greek yogurt cheap nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine i try to buy all my supplements here too as they seem to be a lot less expensive yes im all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot the downside its not onestopshopping a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a regular grocery store this particular tjs is teenytinysmall and always chockfull of obnoxious andor oblivious people who wield carts like weapons my favorite is the woman who thinks its an awesome time to teach little jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willynilly im all for giving your kid responsibility but a you still have to you know keep an eye on the kid and b a supercrowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not repeat not the time to do so
__label__0 sadly with new owners comes changes on menu my fav barbecue chicken salad no longer has a hint of the same taste it should now be called flavor of tomato also sad to find out that the most outstanding veggie sandwich now tastes like it comes from another country again not a single hint of similarity of same flavor im sure many people will love these new changes yet im sad its not the same i woke up today dreaming about the old veggie sandwich no joking
__label__1 food wise this is my favorite lennys location they make the perfect jalapeno cheese burger the fries are really good too the location kind of sucks its surrounded by a greyhound station a liquor store and some kind of aa hall need i say more
__label__1 with quaint accommodations friendly staff and interesting selection of food choices i was able to forgive and forget that the centurion didnt yet have a liquor license the centurion is a cozy and by cozy i mean small place but it has personality and i can imagine myself hanging out on the patio after work in cooler weather for those vegetarians out there centurion offers a diverse selection choices for our lunch my companion and i split a heirloom tomato with brie panini and the shitake spinach risotto both were flavorful and the prices are quite reasonable at 8each the menu offers a diverse selection which includes burgers pizza pasta salads all around 9 and some higher priced dinner entrees ranging from 2342 i hope to return to try their dinner entrees the blue cheese crusted filet mignon sounds wonderful i feel like i had fallen upon a hidden neighborhood gem im crossing my fingers for their liquor license
__label__1 this is the second time ive eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first the first time i had the meat lasagna and the second time i had the cheesesteak lemme tell you this is one of the best italian places ive been to in phx its very back east feel to it and i love all of the authentic italian foods they have there especially the meat cheese and pasta counters check em out you wont be disappointed
__label__1 i recently saw a coyotes game here and i was seriously impressed this arena is super nice almost malllike and clean on the inside what also impressed me was how much stuff there is around the arena where im from youd have to drive somewhere else if you want to go to dinner before or hang out after the game here you can just stay in your cozy little free parking spot and hang around probably my only gripe is that the screens on the inside could be a little bigger but other than that this arena is right up there
__label__0 winco foods is all the rage now will this continue or will winco lose its luster once its just another grocery store and the new kid in town theres nothing special about winco its your typical grocery im not a savvy coupon clipper or price matcher so i cannot attest to the savings to be had at winco a thrifty shopper i know claims the savings are to be had that said there are two negatives that shine brightly at winco credit cards not accepted and cheap bags do not come here if your earnings are running low i just gathered my weekly groceries and expected to charge em not a surprise i was looking forward to after waiting in the long lines on my first visit most of the bags were torn up the seam and the handles were split for one reason or another the cashier actually helped bag my haul how she could hand over bags so blatantly ripped is beyond me on the plus side winco stocks shasta tiki punch winco isnt a terrible place but i dont see any reason to jettison frys and target unless im in the mood for tiki punch take it or leave it
__label__1 yowza i love this place i had heard great things about this place before and actually received some of the olives and olive oil as a gift last year i decided to take my mom and try it out for lunch the food was pretty good but the best thing for me is that they have cerignola olives this was music to my ears when they told me they had them i have been looking everywhere checking every grocery store gourmet shop in chandler and tucson and nobody has them i cant wait to go back and try the rest of their menu oh and expect a little off roading the parking lot is loose gravel
__label__1 sushi is not just a meal its an experienceeverything from the way fish looks to the crisp green of the seaweed is art the smell of the sake and the sound of crisp sizzle on the grill create an environment conducive to stretching the palette yasus does this like no other sushi placethe fish is pristine the rice like air and the flavors intense and varied my wife and i live a stones throw from this place you would never see it if you didnt know it was there its like a little secret that is starting to get outall i can say is that it is hands down the best sushi in phoenix period get the fried oyster rolls get the grilled mackerel or troutjust try it
__label__0 not a fan i was in the biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats as i picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats my total came to be about 300 i did not have any cash on me so i took out my plastic money the debt card and they wouldnt take it telling me that i needed to buy a few more things because they have a 500 minimum what store has a minimum nowadays the customer service was also very lack luster the dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which i found a bit annoying needless to say a store that i used to like i will no longer be back there are so many other great dog stores

__label__1 if you need something obscure or you need to get everything you need in one place then here you go i also love how many different 1 shot mini bottles bevmo has to choose from
__label__1 i woke up this morning craving a breakfast burrito fortunately just 3 days ago a menu was left on our door for ciscos grill with some great marketing i might add conveniently located right up the street from my house ive been curious about this place since they opened i strapped on my shoes and walked on over upon entering i was greeted cordially and placed my order for a chorizo and egg burrito with cheese the cook went to work and 5 minutes later i was holding a fresh hot burrito and a complimentary pineapple water cisco came out and introduced himself while i was waiting and chatted with me for a few minutes its clear to me that hes very passionate about his restaurant the service is top notch the menu itself is fairly generic typical burger and fries tacos and burritos but everything is so fresh and prepared well id recommend this joint to anyone looking for a quick inexpensive bite to eat
__label__1 6 inch tuna on white bread with everything including spinach but no pickles not even joking this the only subway that ever gets my sandwich right thank you for the 5 meal deal it beats the other chains in this shopping plaza as far as price for lunch
__label__0 sorry banana leaf im usually not picky at all but the thai curry tofu and vegetable dish i picked up last night was awful really it was almost not edible the packaging was not great so it kind of spilled a bit in the bag not a good start perhaps the curry is the yellow curry that jenny r refers to in her review maybe the chef should taste it before serving it it was nasty seriously ive had better asian food from the food court at the mall before i will say you did listen to my request to add eggplant to the dish thank you but if someone requests eggplant perhaps you should make sure its cooked fully next time i had a bite that was barely cooked it was crunchy so needless to say i dont think ill be giving you another shot first impressions sometimes last a lifetime sorry banana leaf
__label__1 just kind of there with nothing special about this convention center and the phoenix downtown area is pretty boring and sparse except for the baseball stadium right next to it with some cool bars and restaurants when there isnt a game this area seems pretty dead bottom line ho hum baseball stadium nearby is great entertainment option but can be a pain with all the traffic if you are trying to get out of the convention center area in the evening
__label__1 came here in a daze after not having slept for a loooong time and flying in to the airport with dad reminds me of the nice breakfast diners in chicago got the combo with turkey sausage still greasydefeats the purpose eggs always the same everywhere french toast more white bread nothing too special but filling coffee nice atmosphere and no major problems would be great for the weekend brunch
__label__1 finally biltmore gets a sushi place after the departure of ayako well if you have been to stingray in old town scottsdale this is same menu etc but i happened to like the atmosphere at this location better came here for a happy hour had a drink called the tokyo teasedelish and since i love sashimi sushi which isnt on the happy hour menu no big deal ordered my sashimi combo which didnt disappoint included tuna salmon and yellowtail did enjoy the bevy of assorted rolls that went by i like the outsideinside seating bar great on beautiful weather days i will be back for more
__label__1 whenever i get my car cleaned this is the place that ill always go to theyre nice efficient and they do a great job my car is still shining a week later the wait is very minimal the staff works together fantastically and you can watch them clean your car so you dont have to worry about anything getting stolen yeah its a little small and a bit shabby but like the first reviewer said you dont go there for the waiting experience definitely worth the money
__label__0 this pizza always tasted great but lately i feel like they have cheapened their ingredients i realize its 5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now if it werent for the flavored crust i would not come back but the main reason i have not returned to hungry howies is because the last time i wanted to place a pick up order i was turned down i asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment youd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed
__label__1 good fast food prices are fair they charge a fee for bank cards
__label__1 fancy shop with great kitchen items that i would use for our kitchen it seems whenever i go in there their products dont work avoid ordering any of their coffee pots because we had to return them twice in a row it seems like whenever we walk in there the employees dont seem to be knowledgeable about the products there i give this store three stars for having a variety of kitchen items and an enchanting place to visit
__label__1 just open i had the roast beef sandwich and my wife had the turkey and stuffing sandwich both were excellent modern interpretations on classic lunches i highly reccommend this place ps ipad driven pos system is way cool
__label__1 too longit took me way too long to make it to sens sens is what we need more of in phoenix seated promptly on a friday night by johnny chu himself johnny chu really has put together a winner here johnny chualright i admit iti like saying his name the asian tapas idea is new to me having dined at some great tapas places from chicago to vegas but alas never an asian tapas joint i must say no spanish tapas place ever made me feel like sens did except the time i drank a pitcher of sangria the tofu dishes are amazing how do you learn to love okra get it at sens the hong kong rice noodles were not what i was expecting so i was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts one taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor fantastic i will be back to sens tapas sake bar soon do you think you could invent an asian sangria cmon johnny i know you can do it
__label__0 blahvery disappointing i ended up at the san carlos when it was the only hotel downtown that wasnt sold out i dont think it was worth the 200 a night but i didnt have a choice the shower was amazingly tiny i felt like i was being frisked up against a wall just to wash my hair the walls are super thin i could hear snoring from one room coughing from across the hall and the tv on the other sidejust awful the staff wasnt very helpfulforgot to program a wake up call refused to assist when an alarm had been going off in another room for over an hour in the middle of the afternoon etc the ghost lounge was very cutei went down and it was a swing night which seemed to be fun id be willing to come back to the lounge but not the hotel for sure
__label__1 i think the lady behind the counter didnt like me couldve just been me i dont know its just how i felt when my boss first told me about this place i thought he said al molina and i was like you mean the guy who played doc ock in spiderman ii ive been here a few times today was the first time id been to el molino in about 8 months i happened to be in the area popping in to buy a backpack at staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when i got back to my office one thing i really didnt like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom thats something very typical of like a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor i went to the bathroom and it said i had to ask for the key i went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so i kinda just did a little peepee dance until she came back it was a little too expensive for what it was a thing of chips was like 450 thats crazy granted the chips are really good and you get a lot of em but dont you have a thing of chips i can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion i got all these chips in the fridge at work that wont be edible on monday probably the burrito i got was very tasty the salsa they gave me was also super good nice and smokey and spicy seriously man that shit was spicy i kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me i had to laugh when i opened up my togo back once i got back to work because i actually thought maybe i didnt get any salsa but when i took a look they gave me soooo much i made a small tower beside my meal like a stonehenge of heat three stars good not great weird bathroom unfriendly lady good food too expensive
__label__1 gamestop burger visiting a friend in phoenix i first see smashburger from the street upon first glance my other friend and i thought it was a gamestop cuz the sign looked just like it we both said haha we thought that was a gamestop our friend goes yeah i first thought that too when i first saw it its pretty good there do you guys wanna go so we ended up eating our first meal in phoenix at smashburger and we were glad we did the food was really good and the smashfires were a great addition to our burgers i ordered the bbq bacon cheese it was quite delicious and a little on the greasy side but thats where all the flavor is this burger has some hot steamy buns yeah i said it unlike most places that use the typical sesame seed bun smashburger uses egg buns these buns are a lot softer and compliment the burger very nicely i decided to order the smashfries which are seasoned with garlic and rosemary these were an awesome choice for those of you who may not like those flavors they offer regular fries as well seeing that i hadnt eaten since morning i also ordered the arizona devil dog this had guacamole tomatoes jalapenos habenero cheese and a spicy chipotle sauce all on an all beef hot dog i liked it it was like nachos minus the chips on my hot dog now this place is on the pricey side but if you feel like dishing out 8 for a burger and fries then this place is not too shabby different locations call for different items on the menu so dont be surprised if the arizona devil dog cannot be found outside of arizona i say that they should combine all the regional menus to make one giantmega selectionawesomeness menu but i highly doubt thatll happen
__label__1 best thai food order the dry garlic chicken
__label__1 this little spot in the art district of scottsdale is as good a lunch restaurant as ive been to i had the mahi mahi tacos and was blown away by the attention to detail in the flavors bringing the dish together as well as the wonderfully tasteful presentation of particular note was the attractiveness level of the waitresses about which i dont have sufficient words to do justice both my father and i were hard pressed not to buy a condo in scottsdale just to stay and have all our meals for the rest of our life there solely to appreciate the view they were dressed tastefully not in the slightest bit slutty but holy god
__label__1 i love this place i have been craving their baked spaghetti pie again for 5 years and i finally got it today since im back for a business trip i remember pretty much everything on their menu is fresh and delicious their prices are great too very polite staff
__label__1 first time there the other night friday night not very crowded for 730pm we were shown to a table in what looked like a back room the table was not set there was just a tablecloth and that was it the room is to the right as you walk in there were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered no view it was weird so i immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant decor seemed cheap just my initial impression food was pretty good pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good service was good entrees were pretty good chicken parm fettucine bolognese all tasty but not sure i would go back caesar salad was a bit disappointingasked for anchovies on the side never delivered
__label__1 we visited last week the lady offered us a lot of samples of their food so we could pick out what we liked the food was excellent and the service was great the restaurant was very kid friendly
__label__0 burger was great but the service wasnt so great when thumbing through my wallet for cash the owner rudely interrupted me and told me they dont accept cards only cash payment when my friend asked what he would recommend he shoved a menu in his face and said id recommend looking at a menu i fought back the urge to just leave and go somewhere else and ordered the good ass burger which was avocado and bacon so you cant really go wrong with that the fries were good and the burger was pretty good service 1 star food 4 stars average 2 stars httpdietstartstomorrowcompost2983024079twohippiesmagicmushroomburgersphoenix
__label__1 delicious def got the sandwich adam on man vs food got i think its called del reys it was sooooooooo good and the sandwich was huge the price was great however there was a long wait so id say be patient for their services
__label__1 never having dealt with a discount tire in phoenix before only in texas and their service has been great all the time i came in not knowing what kind of service to expect i was pleasantly surprised the store had a good amount of parking and the store front was clean open and had adequate seating around the perimeters there were already 56 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative all the guys working there were busy helping someone yet were saying hello to us and reassuring theyd get to us very soon i didnt wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by wally he inspected my tires recommended a plan of action gave me options and we headed back into the store after i made my decision to replace 2 of the tires he checked their stock and unfortunately they didnt have them there but he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning so i could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed great the prices were not as heafty relief and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced it took exactly the amount of time theyd told me 45 min they apologized for the wait but no need for that the guy who helped me on the 2nd day im sorry i forgot his name was also very professional and great i recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely thanks guys tip if you know you need to bring your car in you can make an appointment with them online they take walkins but i believe it helps them manage their customers easier and that in turn benefits you
__label__1 was out on a date yesterday and we had worked up an appitite we were on the light rail and decided to stop off on mill to find food walked down mill for a second and found silvermine subs score i had never been here before but i liked it its not the fanciest place simple location good food decent prices they seemed to have a good selection of hot and cold subs with different side items and combo meals i got the king bullion and it was tasty i went with the small sub 5 inches a large pop and some chips food was up in no time flat seems to be a college kid hang out especially considering the location would return in a heartbeat tasty reasonably priced and right off the light rail on mill
__label__1 this is my neighborhood chinese restaurant and a family staple i personaly like the roasted peking duck the shrimp lomein is good fast friendly service no msg lunch specials during the week are awesome too
__label__0 ill be charitable this place sucks i went there because a friend had exactly the piece of furniture i needed and he got his from ikea after wandering around the store forever i finally found the right department the people working there were cold uncaring not helpful no concept of customer service i left in disgust couple of days later i was in cost plus world market 18th st camelback voila i fould what i wanted for close to the same price the big difference warm smiles friendly people volunteered to go out of their way to help me felt like i was among longtime friends they even delivered when they said they would and no need to drive half way to tucson and back ikea dont be foolish cost plus now theres a place that earned my repeat business
__label__0 not lesbiangay friendly at all i should have read the previous review before going
__label__1 good time we sat at the sushi bar and were entertained we brought my 9 year old very picky daughter and she had fun she has some edamame and a plate of plain noodles sticking me for 5 bucks for a small pile of plain noodles i felt was outrageous sushi was good and rolls were fantastic asked the sushi chef to make his favorite and it was a spicy tuna roll with a sweet sauce that was awesome well come back but ill give me daughter a hot dog before we go
__label__1 you know for a goodwill this one really isnt bad they have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see i love the books a great selection of books you have always meant to read and i dont mean the old classics though they have those too like james patterson anne rice and all those gooey twilight books looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon lots of knickknacks and vases and about 25 printers to choose from check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items they is a good chance you will find it
__label__1 this restaurant is close to my office so we go for lunch at least once a month i love that its bright with great modern decor and the seating is comfortable service is always very good the prices and portions are a average for the area the cuisine is a twist on sonoron but nothing extraordinary
__label__1 heres the deal i said i was done with ot but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot my friend was right everything i had a problem with before was remedied i went in unannounced didnt tell anyone about a previous bad experience and i was given some of the best service ive received in town when we went in we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit no texting employees no indifferent waitstaff the chef was in the food window expediting food making sure it went out promptly and correctly not only was our server attentive but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks debris on the table etc the decor has been refreshed and although i didnt dislike the decor originally it is definitely an upgrade as well now its much cleaner but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before props to the new management well done ill be back ps forgot to order side syrup curious to see if they still charge 2
__label__1 fabulous place the food is good and the selection of organic and specialty items is nice love the butcher shop and jerry the cellarmaster is abslutely fantastic seriously if you want a bottle of wine he is the best resource and if you go back frequently he tailors his suggestions to what you like my favorite thing about this store is that the staff tries so hard to treat you like a valuable customer they remember your name ask after your kids and honestly act like they like you it feels like a small town grocery store and i love that breakfast is fantastic and the coffee is great everyone at the coffee counter is terrific this was a really great addition to the neighborhood
__label__1 i was a little bit scared to eat at this place but i was pleasantly surprised i got the chicken egg foo yung and boyfriend got spicy shrimp the portions were humongous and it was very delicious the buffett didnt look very appetizing i would definitely only order from the dinner menu cant wait to go back food is dirt cheap and so delicious
__label__1 nice park but people need to keep an eye on aggressive dogs my 4 month old puppy was beat up by another dog this morning 772012 we were the first ones out there this morning around 515am we were just out there walking around this lady and her grey and white dog was walking around then the dog came up to us for no reason and jumped on my puppy just started beating him up the owner didnt even do nothing the dog was almost killing my puppy i yelled at the dog tried to stop him then he attacted me bit me very bad on left hand the owner asked me where i was going i said west valley hospital i was very scared she said she would meet us the hosiptal i never saw her show up those kind of aggressive or angry dogs shouldnt be allowed out there yea go at your own risk but people should not let angry or aggressive dogs out there the owner didnt even say sorry or give me her name nothing shame on her and her aggressive dog i hope she teaches that mean old dog some manners brenda hansen the hosiptal visit was long but west valley took special care of me thank you hosiptal
__label__1 great neighborhood sports bar theyve got something like 35 hd tvs all arranged so you can get a good view no matter where you sit the staff is friendly drinks are inexpensive like 1000 for 1 beer and 2 vodkasoda and their food is tasty they have a large comfy outdoor seating area if you want to catch some fresh air my only complaint about this place is on the weekends they usually have a cover band not that the band is terrible or anything i think they switch it up so its not always the same band anyway but theyre loud and if youre there to watch a game forget about hearing anything relating to the game including the people you are with i can see how this could go either way with people since it does add kinda a rockin environment which is nice depending on your mood oh and they have those satellite speaker things so you have this box at your table and you can tune the sound to whichever game youre interested in listening to not that it matters when the band is playing but every other time its cool
__label__1 oh good another paradise location for meeting up with friends after work clean neat and well manned the worker bees seemed in real force cleaning refilling and picking up plates nice to see food wasnt quite paradise but it was tasty and filling i usually have the panini with chicken and artichoke but today went for a chicken wraptasted like a chicken wrap the peach decaf teas was refreshing and the mango tea was too i love the casualness of the setting and the ease with which you can order at your leisure if you are meeting people with different time constraints this can be very helpful
__label__1 great discovery for me i popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised i had the best veggie tacos ever they were extremely flavorful and filling i dont know the secret to the accompanying rice and beans but they were also on pointjust delicious the only drawback is the size of the place since i dined alone i sat at the bar it wasnt the most comfortable seating but id do it again in a heartbeat for those spicy veggie tacos i will definitely return to fuego tacos
__label__1 awesome food highly recommend had gyros platter generous portions and excellent meat check out their spices and other food stuff got couscous very cheap
__label__1 if you are staying in phoenix for any length of time this is a must stop for at least a cocktail from walking through the kitchen to being seated promptly in a booth this is quintessential gastronomic delight durants is an icon and legend period wine list is great have a wellversed sommelier also i never order filet but when in rome
__label__1 ok so this is how much i love this product i first tasted lees at a yelp elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again when i was invited to the next years elite pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth is lees gonna be there ok maybe the whole french restaurants bone marrow gravy came to mind too but i digress when i made it inside to pleydate i literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner i am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now the funny thing about that is i am not even a big ice cream lover i will have to visit the shop soon
__label__1 i love pita jungle everytime i am in town i make it a point to get here the food is fresh and healthyish there ice tea comes in a variety of wonderful flavors and is so delicious i would recommend you eat here especially if you like yummy food with a medditeranean flare
__label__1 ive always had a pleasant experience at mojo in tempe marketplace i have been to this location about 4 times and they always provide good quality and value my favorite is the red velvet froyo
__label__1 cute coffee place located right near work so i stop by for an iced chai and a muffin before my morning shift the staff is super friendly and knows my order by heart which i love pretty good chai too not the best but much better than some other places and when its made like soy it still tastes spicy and delicious unlike a chai i had at cartel which tasted purely like soy super disappointing i havent tried their avalanches yet but i really want to they look really good prices are decent too about 5 for a medium chai and a delicious muffin i think the decor is cute too looks like it belongs up north in flagstaff or sedona all in all if youre in the area definitely stop by but i wouldnt necessarily go far out of my way for it
__label__1 i ordered a thin crust pizza for carry out from this location the staff was very friendly and the pizza was pretty good i look forward to trying their pasta in the near future
__label__0 this review is based solely on service not the food i am sitting in a booth at ra as i type this that is how upset i am with the host staff at ra i called ahead to inform the restaurant that we would have a party of 8 when we arrived the girls at the front were so rude i almost walked out we waited 35 min for our table and the entire time the host staff was looking my entire group up and down giving us the stink eye i am sorry that you are 18 years old work for 8 and have a stick up your butt but do not make us feel unwelcome my girlfriend and i went to the back to use the bathroom the host followed us back and asked us what we were doing not to help us find the bathroom but just to be a snob from here on out ra is ruined for me
__label__1 teds rules great chargrilled hot dogs killer onion rings and a great atmosphere all add up to a good old dogeatin experience
__label__1 why did i wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot having a father who grew up on los olivos i remained a loyal customer that is until last evenings change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of los sombreros authentic mexican cafe cantina i am not an expert on authentic mexican cuisine nor will i pretend to know what the flavors of san miguel de allende taste like however i am a foodie so i know good food when i eat it we chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another cardinals loss sad i know since they were off to a great start lucky for us it was a calm monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter aka the bartender phil no need to blush if you read this did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey my friend allowed phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while i allowed phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar no salt heavy on the tequila preferencesand that was just to start perfectly crafted margaritas in hand check now what to eat for dinner my friend ordered his beloved mole poblano 1895 while i couldnt decide between the smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema yumm and the pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce or tinga poblana sauce1895 i opted for the pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and once again my dinner friend had order envy thats not to say his mole was par or dare i say subpar because it wasnt it actually has received many culinary awards being named best mole both locally and nationally but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach perfectly sautéed chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla isamazzzzzzing its also fair that i note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides as we ordered they also offer up tacos 3 at 1095 various quesadillas 595 and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole salads and more deciding id save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth i boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert undecided again and so we trusted our gastronomy guide phil to choose he selected the mexican chocolate cream pie to finish off the evening and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as i always like to do thank you phil and los sombreros for the memorable dining experience the food was outstanding margaritas made by phil are the best and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for hh or even a late night dessert thank you for staying in the neighborhood azucena tovar and congrats on almost turning 20 years old
__label__0 i have had it with the meat department at whole foods market on scottsdale rd the mayo blvd they really suck i gave them another chance out of desperation really and they blew it i am so disappointed i purchased some turkey breasts there 3 of them at around 3000 for a 4 lb breast i came home froze two and cooked one it smelled but my husband insisted that it was the smoked smell of being in the butcher case with all the other meats i trusted his opinion and cooked it upon slicing it up for dinner i found that the free range turkey was very fatty it was gross but no one got sick luckily well now i just thawed out another one and the same thing but worse it stinks like the rotting dead animal it is it is definitely bad and it gets even worse as i inspected it and opened up the two breasts whole foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one i pulled out about 8 inches of thick fatty i dont even know what from it lets just say it definitely looks like the dead animal it is too what ever that stuff is it is all gray and rotten they are basically stuffing their turkey breasts with junk to make more money i have had it with them i am not surprised they have always been trouble frank the manager there is really not the kind of guy one would trust with food his is kind of creepy and gives off a dirty i dont care attitude i spent over 10000 there on turkey ground whole and he frank still charged me for the breast bones and another employee told me that they usually just throw them in the trash the meats at this butcher department cannot be trusted the manager there cannot be trusted and has failed every time it is really gross top dollar for top trash my husband thinks the manager is getting some sort of incentive for selling the questionable meat instead of throwing it out i am still nauseous from the smell sight and from touching all that gray rotting gross stuff bleech i think i ate that in the last one
__label__0 this is a club not a lounge or supper club i was drugged and dumped here by friends a few months ago fri around 10pm it is too loud too packed and drinks cost too much i am certainly not one of the beautiful people who belongs here good luck
__label__1 this restaurant has the best italian food i have ever ate in my life definitely one of the best restaurants in az i had the sautéed calamari for an appetizer and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta their bread also melts in your mouth blown away by the service gilda was my server and she was amazing everyone was super nice professional courteous and sooooooo hospitable ive never had service this good at a restaurant other than at cafe poca cosa in tucson seriously amaaaaazing restaurant
__label__1 house special chicken is a must this is not a fancy schmancy place so you know the food will be good never have had to wait for a table the banana thingies they give you for dessert are awesome too i give it 5 stars because of the huge selection pei wei and pf changs are ok but they have a limited menu and a large wait
__label__0 what was dunkin donuts thinking when they took out the selection of donuts and now only offer a choice of 10 it used to be you couldnt decide which one to get now you just have to settle for what they have this new and improved dunkin donuts is the worst i will return for coffee when i get the urgebut never for a donut oh and another thingmy dunkin donuts used to have baskin robbins insidethat is gone tooagain what were they thinking
__label__1 bad service great food awful coffee
__label__1 we happened upon this place on sunday we had our 2 12 year old with us and she was yelling about being hungry we quickly ducked into zinburger all three of us had burgers the kids burger was huge and it came with fries we also ordered the sweet potato fries the people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious i also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time ill order those instead of fries we were in a rush and had something at 6 pm we told the waiter we were in a hurry he was great friendly and accommodating we were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there everyone was so nice my constructive feedback would be that i ordered my burger medium well and i received it medium rare it still tasted yummy and i ate it had it been served that way to my hubby he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger
__label__1 5 stars isnt enough i love the whole briggs family i have been going to this dentist since i was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me i love that i walk in the door and they make me feel right at home they are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting they use the most high tech things i have ever seen and its good to know im getting a care for my pearly whites i recommend them to everyone i know
__label__0 the food wasnt that good but that wasnt my main issue it was the unwelcoming feeling i experienced i will not be returning the owner was friendly with everyone in the restaurant except my boyfriend and i he would go table to table and talk to people and greet new customers and would acknowledge them when they left the only acknowledgement i was received was an uncomfortable feeling of him staring at me when i wasnt looking im assuming due to my abundance of tattoos i felt judged and will not recommend this place to my friends or will never return
__label__1 my husband and i went tonight to teakwoods for the first time we had a groupon the place was packed different football games going on tvs all over the place i didnt mind but my hubby was in heaven hostess told us every table was full except outside so went outside turned right around because i forgot about smokers lol we waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple we said sure there was 6 chairs and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us it was same as if we had our own table worked out great we started off with the jess jess boneless wings delish not wet like other wings in fact i think they coat them and then throw them on the grill we loved them i ordered a southern thang burger my hubby got a teaks touch ém all they were huge we each ended up taking half home not just huge but tasty i loved mine we decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back great place waitress nice and friendly good food we will eat there again

__label__1 this location has closed went by today and found an empty restaurant
__label__1 loved this place since it open but they have changed their menu up a little and it seems they have cut corners and products out of there repartee the sandwich i got this weekend was very bland and somewhat disappointing in portion size ive grown accustom to at the wbc and theyve discontinued making their bread salad very disappointing i will be back but with fewer expectations i guess i received an apology letter from the founder and an offer to refund my money i dont need a refund this is not what yelp is about but it was really refreshing to know that a company still cares about their customers reviews after re reading my review it may have sounded worse than my experience actually was the sandwich i got was a new one from their menu named the spicy chipotle egg sandwich it was good but i like spicy i may order it again and just ask for an extra egg and some more chipotle sauce the gentleman did give me the recipe for the salad that ive enjoyed in the past this type of service is what makes a customer for life
__label__1 what can i say this is awesome i am a donut fan and would give dunkin 4 stars just like this place great variety great coffee fresh donuts the extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough its very fluffy and its done just right dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and old when they have been sitting for a while for some reason the bosa donuts dun get too hard even after u buy and drive for like 12 hour home i know its not located in the best part of town but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru they accept credit cards and discover
__label__1 asiasi menzamenzacomme ci comme cayou get the jist so so a solid soso he liked the tacos i liked the steak salad it had a nice little kick to it service was goodthe atmosphere just wasnt my cup of tea that said i can see why some people like it here drinks were solidmenu was decent good place to get hammered i suppose i had a pinneapple mind eraser that was
__label__1 every time i go in this place its always a great experience my wife and i have been going to lucilles pretty much every other sunday for the last couple months her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the kansas city ribs but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles if youre on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option sometimes i get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning the bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game i would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends but make sure you get the fried pickles you will not be disappointed oh yeahplease please please order the mac n cheese as your side you will thank me later q
__label__0 just wanted to chime in say that this place is so vegetarianunfriendly its not even funny i was dragged here with family ended up ordering a chile relleno which was just about the only meatless item on the menu short of a fucking cheese crisp it wasnt terrible but this place is really just all kinds of lame service was mediocre food was mediocre with as many awesome authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley theres no reason on earth to come back except maybe to try a mango margarita
__label__0 ive fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games i come to hang out with friends and play some games i can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since i had a coupon for the place i really didnt care about price at the time with the coupon after being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine after we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time when the waitress finally returned i had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well my drink was empty so i would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but i caught her before she left my boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm we had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time it wasnt for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well it was as if they closed the place down and just left us after the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her the plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take themkind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but i guess i shouldnt be so subtle next time the food was ok at best nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if i had to pay full price for what i got if that waitress had left us like she did and i didnt frequent the games i wouldve walked out probably wouldnt notice all in all go for the games if anything else the games are even ok that is if they are running sometimes i come in and games are off or not working this is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up
__label__1 cute place nice drivethru window adorable really nice patiodininglounging noiselevel inside was a little loud but there were eight people six of wc were talkative yelpers ha plus kyle and chad owners of dlish who were btw easy on the eyes a great asset for any business one special request please offer maya chai while oregon chai tastes ok im allergic i suspect there are natural flavors involved and organic maya chai is multipletimes better and most importantly i dont recall feeling negative effects after great spot to unwind and rejuvenate will come back soon to try the food
__label__0 i really hate to do this this restaurant is fit for those that think taco bell is a great place for mexican food the buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items no white rice my sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre china garden has hands down the worst eggroll ive eaten given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see china garden had regulars one guy at the cashier even commented that hed been coming since 1970 i dont get it this is the worst restaurant i have ever dined at the staff and whom i presumed to be the ownermanager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food
__label__1 great place for happy hour and drinks really cant beat pints at 250 good long happy hour 7 days a week the sandwiches are all good the salads make great sides instead of the chips and the tiny cherry sized tomatoes are to die for whether you get it on the bruchetta or cheese board plate thursday late happy hour gets pretty busy and so does friday late afternoon into late evening saturday night it picks up after happy hour ends wish they had burgers and fries like the living room in downtown phoenix
__label__1 good indian food not great came in on a saturday night was craving indian not busy at all never a great sign the samosas were the best in town piping hot with a great filling that was redolent of spicies and not super mild like some other restaurants the lamb korma and chicken tikka masala were okay for some reason it didnt pop for me it had nothing to do with the spiciness level it was just missing that extra pop you get from a truly great curry i dont know if the spices hadnt been freshly toasted or if it was lacking a crucial pinch of love that day but i wasnt feeling it i left full but not quite satiated of my indian food fix and the quest for the best chicken tikka masala in town continuesoh i should mention the interior of the restaurant is beautiful the service good but the prices a little steep for my taste
__label__1 buffet is great good selection of food even for me the picky vegetarian naan tastes great choice of plain or garlic naan food generally tastes good rating on buffet alone i would have given 4 stars however i might not return there for dinner or takeout dinner entries are priced well above 10 and generally use frozen vegetables crinkle cut carrots anyone god i hate those the last time i ordered take out the quantity of my dishes was about half of what i got the previous time fine can i pay you a little less than the bill and the food tasted subpar and my naan was burnt for this they get only 1 star good place for the lunch buffet
__label__1 the menu here is great so much to choose from and its always good no mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated the jambalaya is a big favorite and the pizza here is awesome ive also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit
__label__1 the service here is wonderful let me start by saying that our waitress im mad i didnt remember her name waited on us on the patio she was so nice and our friend can be a little overwhelming and has a strange sense of humor she made sure everything we wanted we got even modified the desert special so we could have a hybrid of the white chocolate chip ice cream and a brownie dessert my filet was wonderful and at a great price of 24 bucks me living in san francisco where filets cost 40 bucks a piece this was up to par the corn salad is also worth mentioning wonderful flavors anyway i could have been happy with many items on their menu also get the dragonberry lemonade it is on their specialty drinklist and is great on a hot day
__label__1 i wanted to check this place out as i had got my mother in law a gift certificate for here it is what appears to be an old farmhouse that was left standing in the middle of scottsdale busy city life the inside is very charming like stepping into someones home with all the good smells of cooking we didnt make reservations and since it was a sunday knew we were pushing it especially with the after church crowds but as luck should have it was able to sit outdoors and was such a nice sunny day was great i had the chicken wild mushroom and leeks crepewas that ever heavenly my husband the strawberry chicken salad which he also enjoyed one thing that drew my attention was that there were a lot of women senior citizensvery well dressed onesobviously part of the scottsdale upper crusti think we were the youngest ones in there next time im back in scottsdale will have to go back
__label__1 my croissant with ham eggs swiss this morning was fabulous came with a bonus brownie saved for later was very yummy too orange juice please try the iced tea the way the owner makes it is amazing like nothing ive tried he mixes a kind of apple cider that they make onsite with fresh mint everything is made from scratch i love this and do not mind to wait a couple of minutes for beautifully personally made for me food even hummus is made from scratch from dried chickpeas i was very pleased my belly was full
__label__1 mmmmmmwhy did i wait so long to try this unbelievable pizza i would give 5 stars bjt the service waswell not great its ok we all have off days well be back
__label__1 is it worth the trip for a chirico and egg sandwich from chaka chaka heck yes
__label__0 i must have looked like a poor ugly person the other day bc seriously no one helped me no one even said hi i was in there for an hour too i decided not to buy anything bc the service was so bad this is a little bit like ojs i didnt kill my wife but if i did this is how i would do it in that if someone had helped me i would have bought 6 place settings mats chargers napkins and napkin rings i also would have bought several drapery panels but no way was i going to spend that much money at a place that couldnt even say hello or ask a girl carrying around a ton of place settings if she needed help so i just set everything i had gathered up over the hour in a pile and left youre welcome employees hope you had fun putting everything away i also hope they work on commission and are regretting not saying hi to me
__label__1 been twice authentic high quality great price for what you get salsa de chile de arbol was the best loved the decor orchata tasted fresh which is a rarity in most mexican restaurants
__label__1 i had a date in january here with jen we got the meat pizza which was great i thought our date was pretty good but wasnt quite up to the hype of our texting and online chatting she was very talkative and definitely an adventurous extrovert she lived in new york appropriate nypd pizza topic for a few years to be close to theater but moved back to arizona because of lack of money it was another unsuccessful first date not leading to a second date overall i recommend the pizza and the service was excellent
__label__1 i stopped in with a friend on a saturday night after a friend had recommended it to me and was totally thrilled we did we sat at a table for sushi and waited no longer than 10 minutes for a table amazing for 8 pm on a saturday in old towne unfortunately they had sold out of the oysters but the other dishes wed ordered were fabulous starting with a seared tuna dish then softshell crab roll rainbow roll and the green mussels the seared tuna was cooked and cut perfectly just the right temperature with a peppery rub the rolls were a decent size with thick cuts of fish and plenty of flavorful crab and the mussels were a tad overcooked for my preference but the creamy texture and buttery flavor still made it a winner the thing i appreciated most was actually the service we werent rushed or hassled and the food came out a dish at a time giving us a chance to eat and enjoy before getting our next dish at other sushi joints i am constantly feeling rushed while trying to fit all of the dishes on the table and im not what youd call a slow eater this was a happy medium for me the server confirmed that we were ready for the bill instead of just dropping it off without asking its the little details that make a big difference to me my only other con was creepy old men leering at us from the barbut thats what you get in scottsdale
__label__0 wow after eating sushi from across the nation i have to say scottsdales geisha a go go has surprised me for an ultimate low andrew the manager reassured us that we had something wrong with our taste buds for not tasting how fresh the fish was here insulting to assume not recommended
__label__0 what happened to this place the first time i went about a year ago both the food and service were great second time last may i ordered the same dish and it was horrible drowning in sauce but at least the service was decent just went a third time and it will be my last both the food and service were horrible went for lunch sat inside and it wasnt very busy our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things like taking our order to start then even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after i asked her for it in the meantime i counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area which is open so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins my food was not very good and actually made me a little sick this is a shame especially because there arent many places in phx that have vegan choices but for the price you pay i would expect a lot more
__label__1 went to cracker barrel twice while vacationing at our home in litchfield park all the food we ordered were very good and the service was good also i highly recommend their pancakes
__label__1 wow great donuts honestly you cant eat just one i loved the plain glazed and the oldfashioned not like the franchise donut shops these have the real bakery taste
__label__0 i agree with chris l i was disappointed with the cafe granted i was looking for a collegetype coffeehouse where i could grade papers and this place just didnt have that sort of loungey feel that even certain starbuck have there was no background music being played and even with my ipodheadphones on i was distracted by nearby conversations i got much more work done at 3 roots near campus
__label__1 the new location is big open and a bit more like a dinner spot rather than a mishmosh diner but thats just aesthetics i realize the food is great i had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes im not a huge fan of duck but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers mushrooms and ground pork if that helps you find it on the menu the drunken dragon is also fabulous and at 7 for lunch and 10 for dinner yuphas a steal i just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago yum i think its my favorite thai in the greater campus area but then i thought about it and isnt most of the good food in the phoenix area in the tempe area i think so anyway yupha is one cool lady and you can tell theyre trying hard with this grand opening a little asskissing is nice but then again places like these are for regulars so i guess they dont have to be overly nice to me im just here to grub eat here and ask for twice the spicy you would normally the medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium
__label__1 i dont say too many prayers saint or sinner i dont care which is worse which is better corinthians apostles letters dont read the bible preach the word no born again but i have heard of saintly acts around this town the volunteers each morning bound unselfishly they give their time a day an hour can remind you how sometimes the way things go to count your blessings never know hungry homeless most are blessed st marys cares for all the rest feeding famished forty years donations come from far and near warehoused sorted then sent out deserving families who no doubt would otherwise just not be fed but gratefully they go to bed with bellies full and filled with hope thanks to st marys most can cope with unemployment cost of gas mounting bills and dwindling cash humbly they come take what they need a box or two enough to feed their families ease their malaise for weeks or just a couple days so volunteer you wont regret its what you give not what you get easy to say you could or should but doing good will do you good we just showed up put us to work boxes of apples stand and sort with kids from sarrc autistic all httpwwwautismcenterorgdefaultaspx joked and laughed sacked and hauled bags and boxes we gotter dun side by side some old some young so be a saint they need your help then write and post reviews on yelp that maybe someone else might read and too will help good folks in need
__label__1 baiz market is a mediterranean type restaurant or arabic type food well you could get confused and call it that the fact of the matter is though that this place has a very unique touch this restaurant is a staple not only for groceries but also its food the owner is persian so you can tell where the tastes are coming from its somewhat hidden in the heart of phoenix but thats ok once you are there you will be glad you found it this place is unique because they make their own bread are you kidding me i only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago and ive been living in phoenix for 20 years the chicken and beef shawarma have a special authentic taste because of the fresh bread one of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste but the pricing is very fair as well i dont think i can stress this enough but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the phoenix metro area why havent the other restaurants caught on i know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread but their pricing makes them a different story im talking about the persian room in scottsdale i just dont understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away good bread and arabic bread are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives but they just dont taste fresh if you like the bread head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread its baked throughout the day i think i can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation beware though the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days so you really need to use it quickly this isnt bad its just i think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita i usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma but i decided id get a kabob plate one day because i also wanted hummus the beef kabob plate came with hummus bread 2 skewers of beef kabob and some pickles and onions wow the beef kabobs were cooked perfectly and were extremely tender it was a tad bit on the lemony side but i suppose that was necessary to make it so tender perhaps some of the best persian kabobs i have ever had the hummus was definitely good as well i cant stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus this restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus i know friends in tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma and rightly so if youre weary of persian food just check this place out its not expensive at all food for two is like 15 the wide variety of ethnic foods is also interesting
__label__1 they are the best 99 of my pain in my back is gone thanks to patrick obrien and assistant joshua bonnie wills
__label__1 again its a bit unfair of me to rate this restaurant because im from san josecupertino but im gonna do it anyway so being from san josecupertino ive had me some good chinese food and even better dim sum so when the boyfriend brought me here i was expecting something decent but not anything too authentic this place was fairly decent and authentic it has the asian ladies and their dim sum carts it has the og dim sum dishes it even has the authentic less than mediocre asian service the only disappointment is that this place is a bit dirty and raggedy looking and the vegetable dishes are minimal in fact i had to order a veg dish off the menu because they didnt have any dim sum veg dishes and it cost 13 bleh
__label__1 i have been to every ballpark in the cactus league and know my way around them all this is by far the best facility in all of spring training that includes the florida parks granted i am a dodger fan and we get it better than the sox fans do but it is still amazing camelback ranch is the brand new state of the art spring training facility for the dodgers and white sox the sox moved from tucson because tucson is the literally so bad that even people from chicago wont stay there the park is located just south of the glendale airport and pretty much only has one way in or out 111th ave you can avoid camelback rd by taking indian school to 111th and then just drive into the stadium the grounds feature 13 practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields while the white sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public the dodgers are wide open and inviting players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans the field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive not only do they have a full jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out 90 per game that price gets you seats behind home access to unlimited food wine beer soda and sweets it also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off it sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money the grass seats have a great slope to them much like scottsdale and the seat aisles are wide the food selection is lacking without dodger dogs however the stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that maryvale and peoria feature a great stadium and surely one to visit every march
__label__0 i so wanted to love this place id heard great things about the food love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience what a disappointment we were seated within 20 minutes or so of arrival which was great considering the crowd it was nice to have somewhere to walk around and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited once seated however it took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order and another 45 for the food to come our food arrived cold husband and i both ordered eggs over medium mine were runny and undercooked his were hard and scaly home fries were a mound of mushy underseasoned potatoes we were offered jam when the food came but the waitress never returned with it my husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam received a curt yes as a reply but they didnt offer to help in any way for the prices average 10 plus 225 for a selfserve drink i can think of many places id rather spend my dining dollars yes the grounds are lovely and i like that most of the food is from local suppliers which does not mean it was raised on this farm btw but there are many lovely patios in phoenix with much better food and service
__label__1 we were going to movies when the skies opened up that is when we first noticed we needed new windshield wiper blades kinda dumb right but the only time we use them here in the valley is after a car wash think about it so we stopped at this location on northsight next to former site of als beef which is now closed the folks who work there stopped me as i walked in and asked for the make and model of my car within ten seconds we were over to the aisle and had the correct blades for our car wow what a great group a funny aside as we left i started taking out one of the blades and began throwing away the plastic and cardboard in the outside trash bin another shocker it was filled to capacity with old blades great minds eh
__label__1 i stayed here with a group of friends for a 12 marathon that we were all registered in the room that i had faced the in and out burger but i didnt hear anything the pool area is small but if you want a bit of sun i think the best place is in the small grassy area behind the huge wicker chair grab a lawnchair or toss a towel down and enjoy the biggest complaint i had was that the bar didnt open until 5 pm early i know but it was my weekend the room itself was modern and clean the bathroom was nice and so were the complimentary magazines
__label__1 if you havent been to this place go seriously its amazing its the best little holeinarundownstripmall you can find and its cheap nestled between stores like big lots and some electronic place with mexican ranchero music blasting this tiny place is hidden in the corner the owner is from el salvador so dont expect it to be mexican food there are many similarities but the dishes themselves are different walking in you can smell the homemade pupusas seriously it smells like the roadside stands along the bus routes in central america its amazing there are only a couple waitresses and i dont think they speak much english but the menu is in pictures as well as in spanish and some english so you should do just fine get the pupusas theyre like thick handmade tortillas stuffed with either pork cheese and beans or my favorite cheese and loraco flower which is some green and edible plant that tastes a bit like asparagus to me its definitely the best one these things come with salsa and some coleslaw if they dont just ask for the salsa and are very filling the other dishes are really good too for a low price you can get an entire plate of things like meat with rice and beans and this place doesnt skimp on the fixins they put slices of fresh tomatoes avocado and all kinds of other stuff on the plates i honestly love it here if you want to avoid the crowds come at an offhour then you can just sit relax and watch the telenovela on the tv in the corner for dessert pick up a piece of the cheese pie near the cash register i cant recommend this place enough
__label__0 it seems like there is not as much value for your dollar at gold medal we had been there since the new school opened but decided to move on we got a cant we get you to stay call which felt like desperation on their part my daughter enjoyed her lessons but her favorite teacher left as most do and the cost was not worth it anymore i would not recommend them to my friends

__label__1 the lanes and equipment are all new which is great and half the alley have wonderful couch seating instead of the typical plastic chairs the only problem is that it gets very crowded despite having 44 lanes also their weekend rates are pretty pricey i cant blame them since the market bears the price but three games can cost almost 20 per person with shoes which means a family of four will walk out spending almost 100 if you get some food and drinks yikes
__label__1 very very average actually disappointed in the braciole kelsey with the pretty smile and form fitting shorts would probably make me think about going back and trying something different
__label__0 okay i have been to drybar on multiple occassions and have been pleased once maybe twice but it wasnt horrible unfortunately the day of my wedding was horrible my fault that i didnt go in for a practice run but i was assured by their answering service that i would get one of their best because thats who they send out the lady that came to our hotel room to do our my mom and me hair was rude and not talented she barely spoke and when she did it was defensive and not from a place of yes when a bridesmaid who went to drybar to get her hair done and wasnt satisfied agreed with me that my hair style should be fixed the stylist looked at her phone and saidwell what time is it as she argued with us that she couldnt do anything else with my hair because its fine we were like we dont care what time it is its my wedding and i will pay you whatever it takes to get my hair looking the way i want it my mom hated her hair took pictures to send to drybar and then fixed it herself the problem with getting a quick solution is that they have an answering service which makes problem solving an issue especially when you have limited time and makes scheduling a large group complicated again ive been happy once or twice they have a few good stylists and a lot of very mediocre ones i think ill try some of the other blowdry bars in town
__label__0 being new to the phoenix area we were looking forward to finding a thai restaurant since we eat thai fairly often going off of the yelp reviews we decided to try swaddee we ordered the tom ka soup with tofu instead of chicken and the pad seeew with soft tofu and the veggie rolls to go the veggie rolls were tasty and larger than were used to which was a nice surprise the tom ka soup was a little more sour than were used to but overall still tasty however it was almost 11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost the pad seeew was the most disappointing part of the meal the flavor was fine nothing special but not bad however it was pretty dry and sticky like youd expect from a cheap college thai takeout joint overall nothing really stood out we had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for takeout but weve had far better thai for half the price well keep looking for a better thai place to become our local goto
__label__1 a nice place to watch a game nice that it is open enough that you can keep an eye on the game while you survey your many dining alternatives i also they let some natural sunlight and keep the place cool at the same time anyway i dont have a good reason to give this place one star or five stars hence three stars
__label__1 ive always been partial to harkins theaters because they have the best seats i used to say you know what would be the best theater amc experience with harkins seats guess what amc westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that i love this place its frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it not to mention an imax the experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable nothing really more to say that its a theater i do like the new stubs card that they put out yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it but its only 12 a year not bad for all the free stuff you get another cool thing about this theater is the location if you are going to grab dinnerlunch before hand ther eis a ton of places to choose from nice work amc on making a great theater ohhh big big big heads up be sure to see a movie before noon or ya get to pay nice big money thats probably the draw back ill still give you 5 stars
__label__1 came here for breakfast yesterday it had been years since i have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service place was empty at 9am on a tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual this place is pretty much been here for as long as i can remember and i am one of the 2 people that are native to phoenix i always felt it was pricey but i think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when i went yesterday i loved the chips and salsa the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick i went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isnt my favorite but i like going with what waiters say so i gave it a try it was great very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together the tortillas are fresh and homemade tasting the hash browns and beans were good too i read my newspaper and drank my soda while i enjoyed the whole place to myselfoh yeah i read some yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too ha ha
__label__0 i have gone here quite a few times i like having a diner close by for breakfast and newspaper reading but this one is always short staffed and there doesnt seem to be much management around to smooth things out food is usually good but staff always seems stressed out may be due to serving hoards of poor tipping elderly
__label__0 ive been here twicethe first time was driven by a rumor that they made their own root beer im a sucker for homemade root beer so i had high hopes that this place would become a favorite my husband and i were so excited when these huge glasses of rb hit the table and then confusionboth of us looked at each other and said wtf worst rb ever what the heck was in this drink that made it taste like ass we looked all over the menu and found nothing then we saw the fine print on a small table signstevia its made with stevia not sugarim sorry but i have to say that this is the lameest root beer on the planet if im going to treat myself to a big glass of homemade root beer i want it to be delectablesugar and allno freaking high fructose corn syrup and no bloody artificial sugars and yes i know stevia is natural but who gives a crapit tastes terrible anyway after the root beer debacle it didnt get better the food was mehservice was not so great there were moments of is she ever coming back id say go here for the beer sans root but thats about it otherwise skip this place and drive out to four peaksyoull be happier all around
__label__0 i dined at this restaurant on a saturday morning and was actually the very first guest i got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated the service was phenomenal from when i walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing i ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree when my salmon dish came out i said to my self what in the hell two extremely thin slices of salmon little salad and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side salmons cheap and they charged me 15 for this crap i work in the food industry and the food was crap next the entree the waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth explaining to me how delicious this special was so i took his advice and ordered when the dish came out i said to my self again what in the hell four small scallops 2 baby carrots broccoli rabe and cilantro sauce the scallops werent seared enough the broccoli rabe was brown and mush and the baby carrots were still raw the funny thing was the sauce didnt even resemble any cilantro flavor at all i could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet 32 for crap the meal came out to roughly 60 and i left that restaurant to never try it again i could of gotten some pho for 8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasnt even mediocre
__label__1 ladies in the flooring section are very knowledgeable and helpful though i do think they are a bit understaffed they were gracious and friendly fairly large in stock flooring section compared to other stores
__label__1 it is sometimes difficult to start out busy and maintain great standards from the beginning the parlor seems to be nailing it hip yet comfortable decor very creative design and i loved he subtle yet present homage to the former tenant salon de venus as soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm and sincere smile and that same enthusiasm was felt by every single staff member we encountered ah the food fresh ingredients a great light pizza crust and an original beet salad all had us raving the only minor picky foody issue was the nectarine crustada for dessert was luke warm at best would have liked a nice hot dish to melt that delicious ice cream but why nit pic this place is a big hit from the moment you walk past the fresh herb and vegetable garden to the fantastic staff and the savory food this place is already on my regular rotation
__label__1 what a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband the store is filled ceiling to floor with all varieties of toys for all age groups shelves upon shelves of brands and models youve likely never seen if your main toyshopping stomping grounds are toys r us or walmart the stores management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store toys are sprawled across the store ready for the next childs little hands yet it didnt feel messy in there the aisles are wide and smooth the store is organized into various zones dolls science blocks books baby etc this is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where youre always hardpressed to find nonchain stores
__label__1 this is my first review on yelp so here you go i love yasu this is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in phoenix i have been there numerous times and it never disappoints you have to try their sumibiyaki which are items cooked over japanese charcoal last time i was there i had the beef tonguesounds weird but its so good nigirisashimi are a must they always have the best selection and daily special most importantits always freshthis is definately important the sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order you will find the fish is sliced with great execution request fresh chopped wasabi you will never eat sushi with out it again love this place
__label__1 i stayed here for work and had some meetings in the area which made the location very convenient for me i just hopped in my car and was at my office 5 minutes later the hotel seemed pretty newish and there were free cookies at check in there is also a restaurant downstairs and a gym if youre into that sort of thing my room was clean and well kept my only minor complaint about the room would be that the air conditioning is super loud there are a couple of restaurants right outside but they close pretty early other than that there isnt too much close by but if you drive up the street a few blocks to happy valley you can find every big box store and chain restaurant imaginable
__label__1 i heart harkins have for years love the loyalty cups ts
__label__1 fresh easy is the us subsidiary of uk based grocer tesco who entered the american market in 2007 i know tesco really well and they are smart business folks who know their market fresh easy has been opening stores all over the phoenix area and have been using 20 and 10 coupons to build market share i give them a lot of credit for doing this i also have been shopping here for a long time and appreciate their eye on packaging food items for the busy consumer one of my favorites is their rosemary focaccia bread dough ive made it at home but fresh easy make it ohhh so easy when im tired and its 645 btw thanks for the hybrid parking space
__label__0 we chose this place for breakfast this morning because of the wonderful reviews on yelp i was certain it was going to be one of my new favorite places we entered into a brightly painted orange restaurant and stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes waiting for the hostess to finish flirting with the server and notice us she clearly didnt want to be there and could care less where we sat so opted for the table in the window we sat and waited and waited and waited tables that were sat after us already had their drinks and they were not busy finally i tried to get the attention of the hostess who was standing half asleep at the hostess stand mouth open wide eyes half closed a few minutes later we finally had a server our server was not very friendly i dont even think she said good morning we ordered tables sat after us already got their food and we finally got our drinks she bought out 2 cups of coffee but i did not order coffee so i made her take that back our food finally arrived we ordered french toast which came with strawberries bananas and a cinnamon sauce eggs benedict with crab cakes and two orders of country potatoes breakfast was pretty good i enjoyed my crab cake and the cinnamon sauce on the french toast was a nice added touch the potatoes were not good they had way too much pepper on them i couldnt even eat them gary ate a few of his after he drowned them in ketchup we never saw our server again we got a water refilled after we finished our meal and the wait began we waited and waited and waited for our check tables that were sat when we finished eating had already finished their food we never saw our waitress i guess we were her only table if not i felt bad for her other tables as well finally some guy brought us our check and tried to drop it off and run i said wait and gave him my card and said if i dont give this to you now it may be 20 more minutes before we see someone again because i didnt look at the bill first when he brought it back i didnt notice until after i paid that they charged me 1205 for the eggs benedict when their menu actually said 1050 i didnt say anything i just left a sad tip we were there for over an hour they had lots of empty tables and we only saw our server once gary and i always over tip because he and his family owned restaurants in the valley for 35 years he has spent a lot of time being a chef and serving tables we know that when food comes out wrong its probably not the servers fault and things happen so we still tip well today i felt like we were invisible and i have no idea where our server disappeared to for the hour we drove by over easy la grande orange and ihop to try this place we probably will not be back unless we decide to give it a second try on jazz night i do love jazz
__label__1 oh dang this place is good i am in love with the carnitas burrito and the employees are so nice and make some damn good food if youre in the area and dont want taco bell then go here they also give you chips and the chips and salsa are pretty legit try not to stuff yourself with the chips though cause the foods the real winner here i will be back and have been back many many times since my first experience why only 4 stars you ask the breakfast burrito was just aokay i would much rather get a breakfast burrito elsewhere but the regular burritos are the bomb diggity
__label__1 i know this is going to be super girly but i love the peach beer at four peaks and the beer battered fries are amazing
__label__1 this review is composed as a companion piece to the other positives on this page so please read those for details i wont repeat i think jason bs comments most accurately mirror my overall feel for this place and while i find nick ss opinions undeservedly harsh they do contain kernels of truth that shouldnt be entirely dismissed either regarding cleanliness i contend that tonys operates on the european standard so if youve ever been you know if your home has antibacterial soap pumps at every sink you carry antiseptic wipes in your purse or on your person at all times and you fixate on the illusion of a 100 microbefree world you may want to pass on visiting tonys id assume then that you would also avoid any contact with street vendors and food stalls in places like mexico madrid bangkok hong kong et al yeah were all free to set limits on our individual tolerances but at what cost to the fullest enjoyment of all that our one single lifetime has to offer scorpions on a stick anyone perhaps a chilled brewski for starters do you do calamari or not if youre of the more adventurous sort at least poke your nose into tonys for the cultural experience i consider this place a bonafide living history museum with a least three generations of family in evidence and at your service want the lights on in the grocery ask have a question about anything ditto also take time to see the mementos memorabilia kitsch and exotic products liberally displayed onbehind and above the counter and entry yeah there is dust but for me that doesnt diminish the faded festive charm in the least nor does it alter the palpable sense of eras past and present that this place evokes in me see the vintage 50s black and white photo of elvis wsome past friend or relation or more currently the color shot of and shout out from the entire orangewood cheer squad of 09 i admit that not everything at tonys is superfine or to everyones particular taste i dont especially care for the coarse grind of their sausage for example but the sliced meats and cheeses are very good and well priced i would recommend checking expire dates on groceries since the turnover on these items is unknown ive found outdated items at ajs frys and almost everywhere else it happens if youre up for a purchase let you senses and common sense be your guide i second the votes for the subs and the standard size traditional cannoli 215 is a bargain compared to 7 at aiellos restaurant on central which i havent tried another bargain here is the bulk olives while im not a big fan of green or kalamata types by themselves a good tapenade is always welcome with jumbo plain greens 350lb and greeks priced at the upper end of 549lb you can pay 11 and up for the same thing elsewhere let the snoot in you decide to wrap you need to know about their sicilian olives theyre black theyre ripe theyre wrinkled and drycured and shiny theyre saltyvery not sour theyre earthy deeply rich and complex theyre meaty satisfying and delicious theyre addicting theyre sprinkled with fennel seed red pepper flakes and on a good day bits of fresh garlic they conjure mediterranean breezes ravenhaired maidens in aprons and hillsides with goats theyre seaspray and sunshine theyre sublime and theyre 449 match with a favorite wine a crusty loaf a chunk of cheese and youre home where the heart is or you can eat them like candy try at least one in your lifetime sadly tonys skips the minced garlic more often than not if your purchase comes without i strongly encourage you to add your own at home makes a world of difference
__label__1 i absolutely love chompies its the closest thing to a new york style deli that i have found in phoenix they have a very large and extensive menu and everything ive ordered has been really good they also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies red velvet cake enormous éclairs napoleons and new york style cheese cake id say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich although i recently tried the jewish sliders after seeing them on man vs food the sliders were really good unlike any slider i have ever had the challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor very tasty i also tried the western sliders and those are good as well although i live closer to their new location in chandler i still go to the tempe location because of the hot asu waitresses chompies is the best
__label__1 never disappointed with this place get the brisket get the pork get the beans theyre bangin the sauce is delicious the mac and cheese is pretty good the cheesy potatoes are good too the real standouts i would have to say are the brisket and the beans do not skip the beans trust me im not even a meat person but i do like joes because everything is cooked just right order extra of everything and you will be glad you did makes for great leftovers dont forget to get some bbq sauce too personally im not one to douse everything in bbq sauce just a little dip here and there but the sauces are really good even my young niece and nephew enjoy the food its simple downhome good food even the pickiest eaters can enjoy ive never actually dinedin at this place ive always called in an order for pick up or ordered right at the takeout window they are pretty fast my future fatherinlaw wants me to choose joes to cater our wedding rehearsal dinner did i really ever imagine in my wildest princess wedding dreams that i would choose bbq for my rehearsal dinner not really but joes is excellent and were heading toward a laidback wedding theme anyway to take it easy on our many outoftown family and friends i am sure they will all love joes and i cant wait for them to try it
__label__1 over the last 3 years weve lived in the area this place has changed 4 times first uncle bears then tio osos then thirsty cactus or thirsty cantina whatever it sucked and now its tcs pub grub the menu is typical bar food including burgers sandwiches pizza wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections which i always appreciate a good quesadilla so i will have to try it next time the restaurant section which was always dead before has now been opened up and tvs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel thumbs up the place was packed for thursday night football cardinals game but still got a good table close to a tv server who admitted multiple times he was brand new was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu etc still nice enough and very attentive we ordered wings medium but they were spicy and their ugly crust pizza with mushrooms and olives the wings very good i would get them again pizza i wouldnt order it again if someone paid me the ugly crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust too much crust and half of it was burned and very skimpy on the toppings it was pretty horrible honestly the actual toppings although sparse were very tasty good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives so i would order pizza here again if they have a thinner crust option otherwise if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix by all means order the pizza i personally prefer a thinner ny style crust all in all i would come here again based on the good wings and service and im looking forward to trying their other menu options ps text tcspub to 411247 and theyll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft score im a sucker for a deal cheers
__label__1 the restaurant has 6 tables which make it possible for you to eatin but this place is definitely more suited towards take out or delivery just dont expect service if you eatin you order at a counter and if you choose to eatin you will get your soup in a take out container eat on paper plates and styrofoam cups but get your entrees served on platters the house special won ton soup was pretty tasty and was loaded with a variety of fresh veggies as well as chicken pork and shrimp pieces however one key ingredient was missing won tons general tsos chicken was fried and served with broccoli and sufficient sauce the mongolian beef was more mongolian and less beef overall the food was ok except for the disappointment of the missing wontons and i would probably consider this place again for delivery
__label__1 fancy ladies with a few gays sprinkled in this is nm cafe popovers prawn and avocado salad glass of sauvignon blanc make your reservation under candy spellings name you will get the best table works every time
__label__1 one of favorite happy hour places in town if you get the wings here it shouldnt matter if you get anything else great location and nothing else needs to be said maybe a renovation on the parking lot
__label__1 some of the best coffee ive ever had and i lived in portland insanely good selection product tanzanian peaberry off the charts owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best
__label__1 the decor and ambience was very pleasant the staff was very friendly and attentive granted it was a monday night and my wife and i were only one of three parties in the restaurant we ordered the hot and sour soup the puu puu platter sp chicken chow mein and the curry chicken everything was terrific the hot and sour soup surprised me im not normally a very big soup fan but i thoroughly enjoyed it both at the restaurant and as leftovers the next day the portions of all of the orders were very big we had leftovers for three additional meals
__label__1 very impressed 5 pitcher until 5pm and excellent healthy food at a good value free valet parking i look forward to coming back
__label__1 first time hereglad we came free chips and salsa always a great start to a mexican meal hubby and i split the chicken fajitas which were very tasty goodsized portion with lots of red bell peppers which we like served with side of rice and beans guac sour cream and pico de gallo we each ate our fill and still had enough for a takehome fajita burrito d
__label__1 wow i am kinda suprised by the recent reviews of this place my girlfriend loves this place and has been going for the past 5 years she would probably give it 5 stars i really like this place the atmosphere we always get great service the food is really really good and the prices arent bad sometimes very crowded but havent ever waited too long we love going back and cant wait till our next visit
__label__1 nice atmosphere especially outside patio strange to see some people dressed gym casual on a friday night as well as some kids they poured chimay into a pilsner glass so bad marks for that falaffel appetizer was nice but falaffel itself was too finely ground and flavorless salads were really outstanding enchiladas also were very good thai short ribs were pretty good as well great dessert options overall pricey but fair
__label__1 lets face it junk is the antithesis of glamorous when youve got a big pile of crap you need hauled away any guy with a truck will do right wrong you want someone that will be on time is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after theyve picked everything up is polite and fluent in english thinks of valueadded services like emptying your trash bin and represents a local business that you can patronize junk guys ticked all these boxes for me the guys were great and helped me out when i needed some items hauled away from a house that i had sold id highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company so go get your crap hauled away by the junk guys youll thank me
__label__1 great place for cheap drinks everybody knows each other and you can becom part of the playa family quick sharen the owner is very friendly and nice and she will remember your name and what you drink after one visit great place to watch games
__label__1 like anyone else with good taste i think this place was better when it was called the library idk when their specials are but the first jager bomb was 2 on a tuesday night and ill love them forever just on that alone theres plenty of space to sit throughout the bar a restroom attendant and usually a dj it reminds me of sports bars you find everywhere in glendale just with a younger crowd
__label__1 this is by far my favourite department store hands down i have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store without exception no matter what department im in the shoe sas will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe and the staff will even go so far as to send out handwritten thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase big or small tim anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words i am not completely sure that i understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store frankly i would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people one of the things i love the most about barneys is not only the prompt attention of sas but the fact that they arent rushing around trying to help 35 people at once the sas at barneys are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not i have also never experienced a high pressure sale situation here all in all barneys is pricey and there is no getting around it but um so is neimans and that place is a crock anywhere that only accepts american express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you arent carrying neither is no place that i want to spend my hard earned dollars yay barneys
__label__1 after hearing all of the hype on diners drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings we decided to try it we waited over 30 minutes for a table the place is small and outside of a dungy motel the service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly i had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable my partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved the hash browns were so buttery and they were good i wouldnt make a special trip back
__label__1 pleasantly surprised about the cleaniness of the location the friendliness of the baristas and just the overall atmosphere reminds me of a small town cafe with the general coffee condiments centered for easy access drinks were made to order and have never failed to keep satisfied just need to get a drive through and all will be perfecto
__label__0 while i give the management props for honoring our gift certificate even though our total rang up below the minimum price the food was teh ick i got the fish tacos i understand the urge to make them unique and different from the thousands of varieties of fish tacos available in the valley but this attempt was a huge miss the tilapia tasted pretty muddy even for tilapia it was served with a really sweet sticky almost bbqstyle sauce i was alternately pleased that it was so cloying that it almost covered the icky river flavor of the tilapia and perplexed at this odd pairing the avocados also had a funny chemical flavor to them doubleyuck
__label__1 cherry on top is a rare example of design by market analysis committee who couldnt decide on a unique concept so they decided to borrow from all of their competitors styles turning out at least as well as if not better than its individual inspirations the result provides convenient answers to the following frozen yogurt questions cant decide between tart and traditional why not both cant decide between standard or highend sweet mix vanilla taro green tea cheesecake but only at your own risk feeling constrained by four fit all sizes 039oz cup weight subtracted wavering on the topping healthiness spectrum fruit to sugar cereal to nuts to crushed big brand candy available the quality is close enough to most of the relevant rivals as long as one is not requiring the desert honey sweet republic tart variant but correctly and perhaps intentionally the value proposition is that most patrons wont care about the slight dip trading off for the flexibility of purchasing only as much yogurt and toppings as desired while satisfying hersheysacclimated children with a frankenstein of saccharine flavors and junk toppings as well guests from the city pining for the nearest pinkberry with original tart plus kiwi strawberries blackberries and pineapple
__label__1 its just like pizza bianco without the wait this pizza is a 99999 and bianco is a 10 this place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for if bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here
__label__1 followed a dr that i respect to this practice and i have to say im pretty impressed as a long time multifourfooted caregiver i have seen more than my share of veterinary clinics and animal hospitals i know the drill and have seen more than one vacation be sucked in to the great black hole of well of course i want to have the best care the first thing i noticed is that there is no odor it doesnt smell like there have been decades of animals paraded through the doors that feel the need to pee as soon as they enter the room just in case this is their one last shot at leaving something behind then there is the overall feel of the place the office i used to frequent always had a frenetic sort of feel to it files were lost techs were running the waiting room was packed with stressed out clients etc this office was peaceful whether is natural or contrived i could care less my dog picked up on it immediately and her normal omg what are we doing here behavior was replaced with something ive never witnessed in a vet office before she was calm its clean except for the area around me that was covered in the undercoat that zoe was stress releasing there were no traces of other animals the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful i had a huge file that i was bringing in and they patiently sorted through the entire thing while i was there for one of my pets the receptionist offered to set all of them in my household up for me with client files so that i wouldnt have to be bothered in the future i thought that was a wonderful timesaving offer and in the event that i ever have to go with an emergency and am not able to focus on paperwork finally i was in an examination room at the time of my appointment and waited less than 3 minutes for both the tech and the dr i was in an out under 1 hour and that my friends is superior service imho i look forward to a long relationship with palm glen and will happily drive the 5 mile difference from my old vet in order to ensure both my pets and i are treated well
__label__1 rarely crowded 4 tables indoors many more outdoors wifi is usually fast only downside is that its next to a gas station so the visuals out the window arent exactly spectacular but if you care about that why are you in scottsdale
__label__1 omg so good so fresh great burger joint ordered the tritip steak sandwich with grilled onions the steak was tender and perfectly pink husband ordered the original with fries the burger was juicy and a good size the fries were perfectly seasoned and fresh we split a drink total bill was a bit over 14 not a bad dinner price place was empty when we got here at 900 on a saturday night but quickly filled up great service and great food we will make the habit a habit
__label__1 every time going to this best buy ive had a good experience the staff is extremely helpful but not overbearing constantly asking and asking to help like other best buys they ask once then give you your space when you have a question theyre always nice and prompt to answer perfect customer service it gets better though the most recent visit to this location i had bought a camera and even with good reviews online and the help of the bestbuy staff i found out the audio on the camera was terrible just a problem with that model camera we didnt know the next day i returned the camera with its plan and had the easiest transition with customer service too get a different camera within 10 minutes i was in and out with a new and better camera and didnt spend an extra dime it was perfect and the new camera is great just one of the many great experiences at this best buy i would give this 5 stars but the store itself is super tiny so selection can be limited the only drawback
__label__1 for cheap pizza its as good as it gets more selection than the other cheap pizza places and the quality is way better the wings are delicious also especially the cajun flavor if your looking for something like one of the big chains then go there but this is good for the money if you want gourmet pizza then go pay for it dont look for it at the bargain places i paid 29 for an xl pizza with two toppings and 20 wings and everyone was happy just know that its really fast pizza but its better than the other big guys
__label__1 duane is amazing reliable responsive reasonably priced i simply cant reccomend him enough ive used him four separate times now and have been more than happy with each visit i wont call anyone else
__label__0 have been going to lgo since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine several times either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the pizzeria the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant last night the demographic in the pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 3080 years of age several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with its just how we do things and theres no point in asking because they wont turn it down even a little the waiter david said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner really doesnt care hubris is so unappetizing i think the food is great but because i have no desire to support a business that really doesnt give a crap about its clientele ill spend my money lavishly elsewhere
__label__1 excellent customer service super clean and the foods not bad at all despite the fact that i asked for extra mayo on my sammy but got no mayo was a little annoying but for some reason something told me to pick up some packets of mayo so i was in the clear and my annoyance never gained traction into anything that prevented me from returning that and the sandwich was pretty yummo they also give a pickle and a free bag of chips to go with it i do not however recommend the chocolate chip cookie no bueno
__label__1 very nice place with extremely friendly staff the food was similar quality to other mexican food places in the nw valleygood but not spectacular very good portions for the price i dont live close by but will certainly go back when i am in the area
__label__1 this place is very offthebeatentrack im sure most people overlook iti only came across it whilst searching online for somewhere different to eatand when i came across the review on the phoenix new times websitehttpwwwphoenixnewtimescom20050210diningsultansofshish i knew this was it i only docked a star for the extremely sparse decor and atmospherethis place could have been any other type of business with just a change of sign and omission of tables anyway the food was great my fiance ordered skewers of beef and lambim not too keen on lamb but the beef was tender and succulentvery well spicedi had a cucumber saladdiced along with onions and parsley and soaked in vinegarlemon juice which enchanted me so much that i created my own version at home and make it every time i feel like doing a bit of dicingmsg me for the recipeits a bit deathbreathy and laborintensive but delicious and during dessert i could see why samarkand was voted best tea in phoenixthe black tea was easily the best ive ever hadbesides a special brand of blue ginger tea i make a point to keep my cabinet stocked withit was strong and richabsolutely incredible definitely make it a point to search this place outits worth the effort
__label__1 i was looking for a place close to where i live for eyebrow waxing and i was referred by about face salon here according to azspagirls about face are the eyebrow experts but they no longer offer the service they were great about squeezing me in the day i called angela was fantastic she worked very quickly and with a very light hand she is so good with the wax that she doesnt need to tweeze at all which for me is always the worst part granted i dont have very um complicated eyebrows she was very sweet and for 15 i will be returning to her
__label__1 the sales people here are very knowledgable and helpful they are also very friendly and great with reccomendations i know it is a comic store but i only went there for dnd bookssuppliments and ocassional anime i am pretty sure their anime is bootleged but due to how cheap it is and the fact that you usually cant find it anywhere else i dont care they often come in complete sets for like 30 bucks which is great for a whole series i have had problems watching them on ps2xbox sometimes but due to the price i keep coming back now then if it werent for this next part they would have a 4 star they no longer sell dnd books or dice sets which breaks my heart they always had the best selection when it came to dice and i havent been able to find another place that carries more than 56 at a time out of all the atomic comics i have been to i like this one the most the people there are always fun and inviting i cant stress that enough
__label__0 uhhhthese are supposed to be carne fries asu boys think that these are the best carne fries me thinks not the carne fries consist of boiled meat and the order is wrong its supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese over the meat but they just dumped the boiled carne asada on top of the sour cream i told some asu boy about this but he said that i probably had a different person making my carne fries the wrong way what a disappointment but i ate everything anyway because im fat like that hahha
__label__1 i really like this place there arent that many lanes so if you plan to go on a friday or saturday night call ahead and reserve your lane this place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area over where the 10 lanes are there are about 4 pool tables another bar and another table and couches area the end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos they play good music very loud i had a really great time my only complaint we reserved lanes for 4 hours and when the 4 hours was up they wanted us out immediately they started bussing the tables just taking drinks away i was busy changing my shoes and didnt notice the busboy grabbed my drink excuse me i just purchased that i let him know that i understood they wanted us gone but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away as we were leaving i was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine i reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else it really annoyed me i would definitely recommend it for a sunday fun day i didnt feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained
__label__1 well its fresh and its easy perfect words to describe this cute clean little store this was my fave fe in phoenix because it was a mere block and a half from my place i still miss it and i moved away from phx over a year ago i popped in here several times a week to pick up staples it was always an adventure to see which prices had been marked down they even have a section in cold foods where they mark older stuff way down i appreciated their little bundles of veggies which were sold in justright amounts as in not so much that some of it will end up going bad this market was also great for soups their brand was my pick although they have a selection of major brands as well it was also my goto place for prepared healthful lunches perfect for work like the fe premade burritos and pasta dishes check out frozen foods too there are reasonably priced items like tempura and special organic seafood dishes i never found anywhere else i also liked the casual setup of the checkout area with the option for a cashier or selfserve andwait for it i just found out they are opening at least two fes in sacramento okay that wont likely cause much of a stir with the phoenix crowd but i am so excited theyll be open in my area
__label__0 i have been eating at wildfish since it opened and after my most recent saturday evening dining experience i must say the quality of both the food and service have gone way downhill i knowa busy saturday night and so perhaps i should give both the servers and chef a break sorry the menu has changed and so has the quality of food and not in a good way let me just give you a brief sample of our experience the ahi tuna tartare appetizer has been changed to a lackluster combination of flavors the idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served the former tuna appetizer was far more tempting moving onto the goat cheese medallion arugula salad my salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms what happened to the warm crusted goat cheese next we both ordered the parmesan crusted sole while the sole was prepared well i do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past if memory serves me well the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish cream and sole do not make a happy pair i am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu okay and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the sugar snap peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce it actually made me ill to eat it and my companion as well our service was slow and unattentive although i do realize service can be a very personal experience i was sick with food poisoning all day sunday as if the poorly prepared food were not enough to bring down my joy so i caution those of you who may have once enjoyed this restaurant like me think twice before dropping a pretty penny at wildfish
__label__0 this place wasnt that great for the price i spent 15 on 2 mini grilled cheese sliders and a tea basically bar food over priced not much to choose from on the menu plus portion size didnt equal out to what i paid for the crowd is very scottsdale and the staff wasnt that friendly definitely wont go back here again
__label__0 i have been to a buffet like this before but i will never go to this particular one again the food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky we selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill the cook doused our dishes with water quickly cooked the ingredients and returned them in a new bowl there is a selection of crispy wonton bits rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost i selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan i chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite freerange and refills on beverages sat down to eat was not impressed i could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting the bowl of ingredients were all bland perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling and i am almost certain the tofu had gone bad the slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well we obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me and changes in selections we could have taken the left overs home but opted to leave them instead suffice to say i do not recommend
__label__1 i really like the facial i had done i was able to choose what i wanted and i could see the results when i left very nice
__label__1 super fast service of oktasting subs ive definitely had better so the signs hanging all over the place that claim that theyre gourmet is definitely a bit of marketing puffery yes its gourmet compared toactually i think subway makes a better sub so i cant really compare it to being more gourmet than anything really maybe its gourmet because they put a ton of sprouts and lettuce in the sub i will give the place props for the very speedy service i ordered my sub and it was handed to me within 1 minute another thing i noticed about the place was that it was filled with male patrons if youre a single lady looking for a manly man come to jimmy johns
__label__0 overpriced deceitful rude i should have read the reviews before i came here i took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 14 inch not much i asked her how much will this cost she assured me it would not be much it was 60 and she hardly did a thing cant even steam it there i was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed no she said its because the dress cost more yeahlike that matters a guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken out which is a lot more work she charge him 1850 for each pair i dont know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off previously ive been to 5th avenue alterations and they charge me 50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing and steamed it theyre also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive
__label__1 this is a place that you want to go to if youre looking for fresh clean food not if you want a large meal i left satisfied but not full the prices are a bit steeper for the amount of food that you get but you are paying for quality not quantity i opted for a salad which hit the spot but could have been a tad bigger as a result we definitely had room for dessert i recommend the apple crisp
__label__1 the pancakes would be a 5 but the breakfast burrio would be a 3 and the breakfast torta a 4 so i averaged it out to a 4 star a very cute little place and you have to try the pancakes for breakfast you can order just 1 if you want perfect for those of you with something else in mind but still have to try the 5 star highly recommended pancakes
__label__1 this is a great little hidden gem from the outside it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice the food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level the waitstaff are also very friendly they came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an order at the counter place another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in phoenix
__label__1 i want very badly to love this bar i really do it has all the promising combinations of qualities i look for in a local locale great beer i have no qualms about ordering the french canadian hefeweizen that i cant even pronounce spell or at this moment recall with one glass all to myself and lick my lips at many other brews on the menu add a wine list beyond belief and liquor if its your poison too the proximity to my own compound and the blossoming bud that is the central phoenix renaissance is always worth a gold star why commute when staying local is a better option the staff and owners of the sidebar are fantastic from my induction many months ago they sling the drinks with pride and the effort in the setup and delivery of the place doesnt go unnoticed the decor is where things start to slide not because the place is hovel far from it everything is crisp and new from the hydraulic bar stools to the multicolored ambient lighting to the comfy lounge couches to the super clean bathrooms this place is a slice of upper crust for those of us who dont normally even thing to nibble from such a decadent pie herein lies the problem or as my former boozing partner visiting from his new digs in portland put it id like to see this place with about 10 years worth of dust on it not my style but i dig it and phoenix sure as hell needs a place like it in the end i will go back and dont mind in the slightest having a place like sidebar to show off to east valley dwellers and scottsdale brats but every time i reach for the front door i pause and am sad a mere few feet away lies the corpse of the beloved emerald lounge a dark seedy dirty smoke filled haven of locals live music art and personality that is now nothing but a painted over ghost so please support your local bar bring your friends and keep the sidebar real but remember to pause for a moment of silence and drink one to the ghost below your feet us locals will thank you
__label__1 i enjoy their rama chicken their peanut sauce is great however their service is slow it is difficult to eat lunch their because it takes so long if they improved their service my rating would be 5 stars
__label__1 sigh i love places like this it is adorable and unique and intimate and perfect the outdoor patio looks like a great hang out spot but obviously it is too hot for any of that just yet and the interior is small and intimate i was surprised when i walked in as it was much smaller than i thought it would be but who knows where i got the idea that it would be a gigantic place our server was hilarious and fun he happened to be from ohio and informed me he was a buckeye im from michigan but im not a wolverine so buckeyes usually dont hate me and was pretty cool about taking my fun jabs at his home state he was super attentive and even was nice enough to give me directions home horrific sense of direction i kind of wanted to be best friends with him anyway i had the one organic glass of red wine on the menu he brought me a sample first and the pasena both were great beverage choices i also got to nibble on the tomatomozzarella and flaked tuna bruschetta and was pleased with both id go with the original i dream of the day that i find such a cute little place on the west side feel free to suggest one if im missing it the atmosphere rocks and the unique booze options only add to the charm of this place
__label__0 food was tolerable and tasteless the chips were actually tostadas that were extremely hard almost stale when eating the entrees we ordered were bland the rice and beans had no flavor at all maybe that is baja style of food but couldnt find the flavor anywhere the service was great and the ambiance was wonderful but i dont think well be going to this place again
__label__1 great food great atmosphere look for the grafetti out back not mexican food but mexico city cuisine
__label__1 good food good service we go here a lot
__label__0 this is a lake it has water in it its not very clean water the lake police will yell at you if you let your dog swim in the water that sucks i think its semiretarded to review a lake
__label__1 ive eaten at this smashburger a few times and im always pleased with my food and the friendliness of the staff on my most recent visit i called ahead to pick up my familys order and we were not disappointed once again we ordered a variety of menu items and in typical when harry met sally style a grilled chicken spinach and goat cheese sandwich subbing the goat cheese for american changing the multigrain bun to egg a buildyourown burger with an egg bun spicy chipotle mayo pickles and onions an order of smashfries an order of french fries and an order of fried pickles everything was made perfectly to order and plenty of extra sauces ranch etc were provided without having to ask on weekends this shop is jam packed and its a wait to get a table but worth it during the week everything flows very smoothly and the vultures circling for booths is at a minimum i highly recommend this smashburger location whether dining in or taking taking your meal on the go
__label__0 staff was very rude bowling prices werent displayed to the best of their ability extreme bowling itself was over priced almost 20 per person the only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot temperature wise they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on and the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games it was not a pleasant experience and i dont believe well be going to this facility again
__label__0 not impressed start with the service not professional it seemed as though the wait staff was clueless as to the table numbers we were given the wrong tables order twice second the food was conceptually a mess no clear theme or flavor profiles the food was heavy greasy and took forever to arrive none of the dishes were memorable third the wine selection seemed to be lacking and the sommelier didnt know where the wine was from she was serving not impressed
__label__1 the sport chalet is a little bit of a playground for me because they have an assortment of gear and clothing for many sports and outdoor activities among the areas within the store that ive visited in the past are boxing basketball hiking shoes workout clothing swimming kayaking they carry highquality equipment from wellknown brands the store associates are helpful too without being too pushy specifically they acknowledge your presense ask you if they can be of assistance and then move along their way the sport chalet also has a free membership rewards plan as well which is nice to have but not necessarily the selling point for shopping here that is youd have to purchase a lot to accumulate a certificate for a few bucks off although i probably receive a 10 off certificate at least twice a year just for being a member finally the one aspect about this store and other sport chalet locations that sets them apart from other large sports stores such as sports authority and dicks sporting goods is the scuba gear and onsite scuba training they offer you are even offered the opportunity to try it out in their back pool which ive experienced myself you just have to fill out a waiver releasing the sport chalet from liabilities and acknowledging that you are in good health then you change in your swimming gear and head out to the back to meet the padicertified scuba instructor you dont have to put on much gear its just a pair of fins a buoyancy compensator over your back oxygen regulator into your mouth and a mask youre guided by the instructor as you first swim near the surface and then head deeper into the pool i did feel really awkward at first but thats to be expected as i left the pool and was guided to the front door of the sport chalet the other scuba instructor provided some recommendations on some equipment and indicated they do not receive any commission for the sale of certain products i totally enjoyed my first scuba experience and recommend at least trying it out at the sport chalet they offer these tryouts around the spring and summer
__label__1 tasty food great deals at happy hour
__label__1 good reviews are easy to write stop reading this and just go eat there ok well i have visited this place for years now and dont go anywhere else if i am in this area i like the chefs they are friendly and quick they speak pretty good spanish to me and but i dont dare try to respond in japanese ha ha the value is phenomenal where can two people get miso soup salad beans tea ice cream and sushi rolls all for under 20 ive tried the same at say sushi in my hometown of maricopa and cant do it for under 40 or more for two all you can eat is available but i find that ordering individually is more economical great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner the waitresses are asian and i find that suitable for the restaurant some reviews on here complain about them i dont have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well i will keep coming back
__label__1 pretty nice sports bar a lot of nice tvs food is typical sports bar food with a few exceptional choices would stop by again if i was in the area

__label__0 absolutely horrendous this post office will lose your mail repeatedly laugh about it to your face lie about it blow it off make it seem like its your fault and make you wish you had sent it ups
__label__1 great service and great food passed snacks included an artichoke cake served cold with an olive tapenade my favorite was a shaved beef with mascapone dressed in truffle oil the main courses included a cesar salad served in individual cups sliders were delicious with my favorite being chicken with roasted pineapple they had a wonderful shrimp pasta dish that was gobbled up by people desserts were cupcakes in four different flavors red velvet with real cream cheese frosting a chocolate decadent cupcake luscious lemon and finally a vanilla buttercream i will definately recommend them for our next catering event in house
__label__1 this isnt your typical mexican restaurant that puts cheese and sour cream on everything the food here is light simple and fresh we started out with the guacamole which was amazing my sister doesnt even like mandarin oranges but it tasted so good in the guacamole she was eating it like it was going out of style the salsa that came with it was the bomb one was a spicy red salsa and the other one was a tomatillo salsa the green one was so good i wanted to drink it i ordered the chorizo and eggs and my sister ordered a couple of tacos with rice and beans everything tasted great and i even had room for dessert after my meal we had some kind of carmel banana crepe thing it doesnt look like much but it was one of the best desserts ive ever had gallo blanco is my new obsession
__label__1 this is our favorite breakfast place the food is good they have the best biscuits gravy of any restaurant i have eaten at the wait staff is friendly the only complaint i have is that sunday mornings are packed so there can be a wait to be seated
__label__1 1 word pie they have really good pies here traditional and some not so traditionalbut still really good food is ok nothing that will blow your socks off i find it better in my freezer section then in the restaurant pot pie is pretty good too
__label__0 took almost 45 mins for a oil change they told me 20 mins when i got there and it cost something like that as well slow and expensive not 2 things i like associated with my lube jobs

__label__1 best gyro in town we go for the lunch special during the work week quite often i havent been for dinner but if its half as good as their lunch gyro then you wont be disappointed service is great and they always take good care of us
__label__0 when i was younger and first moved to arizona serranos on rural road became a family tradition to get mexican food it was basically all i knew till adulthood if i would have reviewed this place 10 years ago it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and i have money to try better places one by one they all seem to dwarf serranos in most every way i feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this but it has to be said i would still eat at serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore the chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome nothing i have had is gross or anything but its just basic greasy mexican food there are better places out there once again to any family reading thisim sorry
__label__1 wow wow freakin wow i have never ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you learn your name cater to your every need and give you fabulous beautifully prepared food sincewell never i must say i did do my research so i did know what i wanted to try and even though i kind of expected the jw marriott to be more of a snooty place i felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this roy person and his fish i went with my friend amy who was visiting from new york she had been to roys before and is a fellow foodie we got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink its december so a bit chilly but the huge soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had 20 martinis loaded with vodka warning we had to ask for more fruit juice and we are major drinkers just gotta throw that in there our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones i am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine enjoying the late afternoon reading conversingwell if i had any rich or classy relatives that is it was very nice and relaxing plus the mariott property is stunning and i wish i could have looked around the property more than we did when we meandered inside for dinner the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table she was very competent could make recommendations and was pleasant without being clingy we loved her she reminded me of joan cusack sounded just like her the complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them we shared the roys canoe for two which had lobster potstickers beef satay shrimp on a stick not its real name and tuna sushi rolls i must say the lobster potstickers better than sex the beef satay was basically this ultratender beef on a stick lightly flavored and grilled fabulous but the pinnacle of perfection here was the tuna sushi rolls which absolutely knocked our socks off i have never ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment i think our server joan cusack not her real name thought i was choking because as i ate it my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy she bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbsup sign for whatever reason these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine i relive that moment over and over mmm but you know the showstopper was still yet to come i could not believe my luck when my roys trio was placed in front of me it was a piece of hawaiian butterfish in miso sauce a piece of seared ahi and a piece of salmon the poor salmon it was the best salmon i ever had out but next to those two it was like cinderellas ugly stepsister just upstaged by the butterfish which is meltinyour mouth decadence and the seared ahi which surpassed the tuna roll i just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi ever amy got the butterfish we licked our plates clean amy tried my ahi and declared it like i did the best seared ahi on the planet for dessert you know i had to have the molten chocolate souffle how good was it brad pitt could have walked up naked to our table and i would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face amy ordered the 3 creme brulees one had a hawaiian orchid on it and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing the coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that this is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like i think the other flavors are vanilla bean very good too and maybe rum also very good it may not sound like i am doing the dessert justice but when youve been kissing george clooney for an hour then along comes rick springfield which one is better they are both amazing but by the time rick comes along well youre kind of spoiled already roys could not have been better this entire experience was an a through and through the staff was extremely helpful someone walked me to the ladies room when i merely asked where it was oh and need i mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house and you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxipads is out on the marble bathroom counter like party favors for down under thumbs way up

__label__1 i am slightly confused as to what this place is is it a coffee shop yes is it an ice cream parlor wellyes is it an antechamber for the hair salon upstairs kinda seemingly the pink spot giggle is trying to be a few things at once and vaguely succeeding at those goals i like the pink spot giggle for a number of reasons location convenience ambience selection in all honestly it isnt the best coffee shop that the area offers but its another option and that my friends is a corner stone of capitalism consumer choice now i wont be making the pink spot giggle my local haunt that spot belongs to lola and i would never cheat on my beloved tranny but for those special nights when i get the strange urge for simultaneous brain freeze and a scalded tongue ill go down on the pink spotgiggle
__label__0 as you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says cash only atm inside alright times are tough i get it then you see the special board which read good food takes time and there is a clock next to that fine thats cool but the problem is that after waiting for our good food it came out and was awful my wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store 30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away the good news is that we went around the corner to the breakfast club and had an excellent meal
__label__1 if youre a local check out their spas slow day specials most often a tuesday wednesday or thursday its a nice little spa in a great location and the staff was pretty good too it doesnt hurt that trader vics is so close by and has tropical happy hour specials for afterwards great staycation location heres a sample of the newsletter spa specials httpwwwreturnitybizimagesemailvhowvho020210html

__label__1 i searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good chinese food in the valley i am very picky and i rate most chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their wonton soup and the colour of their fried rice having passed my non doughy and not yellow test yup people some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow spanish rice in a chinese restaurant i was able to look into the quality of their other food items when you can deliver mei fun singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue i feel you deserve that illusive fifth star service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items i also note that they offered iced thai tea with cream my buddy got a plate of broccoli tofu and a wonderful kun pao sauce sorry but i think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we hmmmm i am getting hungry i think i will go there now wonder if i should get their pepper steak
__label__1 now this is ramen i even ordered it for take out and could tell with my first slurp that it was everything id been looking for complex broth yummy noodles all the right toppingsthe only thing i would have changed is the pork which was tough and chewy and not meltinyour mouth delicious id definitely try again while dining in to see if the quality id the pork improved the rest of the ramen was so tasty it didnt matter also for take out the service was super quick and friendly the prices are great too i got the ramen lunch special which came with a california roll that was incredibly tasty and fresh and it came out to under ten bucks for a lot of food
__label__1 i dont actually hunt or fish but after visiting this place id like to take up those activities this place is like a giant outdoors amusement park everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store i could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available plus now i know where to buy the furniture if i ever get a hunting lodge
__label__1 i love love me some joes real bbq they have the best ribs in town and their bake beans are amazing theres little pieces of meat mixed in with the beans and its sooo good their mac and cheese is great as well as their corn pretty much everything is great here the first time i went here was when i first moved out to az back in 2006 my fiance took me here because he knows im a bbq fanatic and i swear i though to myself what is this place a cafeteria i did not expect the food to be any good at all well was i took quick to judge taught me never to judge a book by its covers again even though you get in line pick up a tray and order your food like you would to the lunch lady in hs the food is the best they even have an outdoor seating area with trees and lights it makes you feel like youre at a nice park having a nice bbq joes is hands down my favorite bbq joint in the valley nothing tops this anything you order is amazing oh and try their chocolate chip cookie soft and melty and so so good
__label__1 two and a half stars really this place is really quite strange video coffee bar i dont have much to compare it to i guess well start with the coffee traditional espresso macchiato no microfoam large bubbles in the milk too hot to drink right away the shot was good but by the time it was cool enough to drink had lost quite a bit of flavor very friendly service on the other hand given that phoenixfoam tends to be subpar i tend to think that service and atmosphere are almost more viable measures for successful coffeeshops than coffee in phoenix the actual place was pretty odd large paintings of mexican sugar skulls in the back nice chairs and tables an orange fauxfinish on the walls and then the video bar element three huge flatscreens on the wall playing pop music videos from the 90s very strange in my opinion im not sure that cher and madonna really mesh with coffee shop but i guess theyre trying something new i had a nice time lounging and it was relatively quiet with regularly good lighting
__label__1 i recently stayed at the sheraton for two nights while attending a conference in phoenix i was blown away by the services this is by far the best service i have received while staying at a hotel in recent years i received a room on the 15 floor room was what you expect from sheraton the view from the room really sucked i got the room with a view of the hotel satellite and communications towers tv quality was good and room had starbucks coffee room also came with a refrigerator i would like to see sheraton move to nespresso machines after a long day attending a conference was great to relax at the hotel lobby bar the desserts are yummy i didnt get a chance to try the restaurants in the hotel hooters and starbucks are directly across the street my work colleague used the gym he said the pool was really nice and gym had everything you need next time i would definitely stay here again
__label__0 good lord i dont ask for much i ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee they didnt have to bake the quiche just warm it up i waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it the server looked confused and the guy who took my order said he got lost i heard the server apologize to at least three tables but not to me she told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel the last one in the shop and insisted repeatedly that she didnt burn itit was the toasters fault quiche was tasty though the server said it was mushroom and spinach so i had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche werethen i figured out it was mushroom and chard coffee was eh the floor looked dirty there was a paper towel in the toilet ok im nitpicking now the place was moderately busy the small private parking lot was full fortunately i was on my scooter so i could squeeze into a nonparking space easily
__label__1 one of the few legit brewpubs around
__label__1 i stopped in here at 645am one morning and was told i was a bit early im used to coffee shops opening earlier i guess but they were nice about it and invited me in to sit and wait i liked their stacks of latin american vogue and the artwork on the walls was nice they also had ice water out for you to serve yourself i ordered my usual americano and was pleased they have raw sugar you can serve yourself by the heaping spoonful out of a pretty candy dish that was lovely also they are now the only place to carry sweet peas bakery items my favorite thing to do was walk down to danielles shop downtown and pick up some coffee at royal and some of her rosemary shortbread cookies it doesnt sound yummy but believe me they are be sure to ask for some at the time i went the place was obviously not crowded and i received attentive service
__label__1 im going to have to work through this review before i decide on 3 or 4 stars ive been thinking about this since my visit and i cannot seem to come to a conclusion another one of those times i wish we had half star options the parlor is definitely the vigs little baby sister it aesthetically looks extremely similar it has both the same scottsdaleesque vibe and crowd both are in weird outofthe way locations and both are really loud even for a new restaurant with lots of buzz on a saturday night i thought this place was crowded there was over a 45minute wait for two of us so we ended up grabbing a beer at the bar im glad we did because our bar tender was smokin hot nothing better for the self esteem of two brokenhearted girls than a cute flirty bartender after a while we just decided to eat at the bar and skip the whole table idea good choice even though the bar area was really loud on to the food we started out with the cheezy cauliflower appetizer oh my good lord it was amazing it was topped with bread crumbs and baked it was just absolutely amazing it was good later as a midnight snack and good as breakfast the next morning for dinner we shared a pesto and a margharita pizza i loved both of them but the margharita had more flavor and i preferred it over the pesto both had great quality ingredients and were extremely tasty im pretty stoked that the prices are so reasonable two hours five beers an appetizer and two pizzas later we ended up with a bill for 50 plus tip my solo bar tabs are normally higher than that my major complaint though was the whole entire time i was there i had a stuffed nose i dont know if it was an allergy to something they were cooking the wood flowers etc but i could barely breathe the second we stepped outside it was like i had a new nose man i still dont know three four three four okay my decision is made if the 6 tall snobettes coming into the bathroom as we were walking out didnt smash rudely into my dining partner and act like she was antichrist for trying to inhabit the same place at the same time i would definitely go with a 4 but its a 3 for now until things settle down a bit
__label__1 best place around for sweet and sour chicken the kids meals rock as they come with fried rice a choice of meat and beef skewers did i mention their only 56 bucks little outdoor seating patio the only thing weve found on the menu none of my family likes it the egg rolls good prices and food
__label__0 8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg two greasy strips of bacon and a stale muffin they say its pricy because they get it local it has to have substance to be considered anything so whack
__label__1 my son comes here for the tacos but i am all about the chile relleno i never had one with potatoes inside but oh my this was the best my only recommendation would be to order it dry with the sauce on the side i am counting the days until i get back to az the new location is so much closer to us i plan on trying all of their menu butbut that chile relleno is callingme the tacos were very very good though
__label__1 i found this restaurant when they were located in buckeye i have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed my favorite is the redchili frybread with cheese added the service is excellent there you always get treated friendly and with a smile
__label__1 i want the garage to do well it is still a work in progress though three of us visited two weeks ago we were sat right next to a group of 40 55 year old ladies out for a surprise birthday whats with that anyways do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of girls and occupy a large swath of the dining area do you need all the paraphernalia collages centerpieces hats i was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl nope she was the oldest 60 easy act your age while youre at it you are not a size six anymore needless to say it was loud at least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat as if thats any conciliation for the volume 11 cackling first off the garage has good brewskis not a huge supply but what they have is quality we had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs both were great i had schriners sausage flat bread and it was great wife had something i forget and said it was good friend had some large salad and said it was good too overall food was better than most so why the three stars you ask service why do some cool places slip up on this is it because they hire cool people or friends that dont really want to work first off a server we were seated at the entrance exit to the kitchen dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot my wife and i had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet hardly a response we were handed a rag our server not so sympathetically wondered oh they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you the rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing every server seemed in the weeds or confused empty beer and water glasses entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there 60 for three for apps dinner and beers
__label__1 midday parking at this place is seriously a joke but such is the case with a lot of swank midtown lunch spots pizza was great my east coast hailing girlfriend gave it a thumbs up which for an az pizza place is a huge kudos we came to check out both this and the adjoining pink spot coffee and ice cream we ate on the ice cream side so i cant comment much on the decor of the z pizza side good ingredients not the usual suspects so that is a change i will pay for good quality pizza so the price was in line for the quality of the food it did a ton of lunch business but was efficient and the staff was smiling and not hating their life which is always pleasant
__label__0 i eat a lot of asian food of different sorts asian is actually my goto cuisine since i have a lot of food allergies this place deserves a thumbsdown unless you love americanized asian the food was bland breaded and just not worth any money next time im in phoenix i definitely wont eat here
__label__1 alright well seeing as i work right next door my mouth has been watering over this place ever since i laid eyes upon the menu and tonight we finally had some yummy rumbi takeout first things first theyre a little pricey at first glance however their portions are enormous each of us ordered a full size bowlhoney orange shrimp for me jamaican jerk kalua pork for jamie honey orange kalua pork and teriyaki chicken for jamies parents the full size bowls were more than enough to last the average person through dinner and then through lunch the next day packed full of ricenoodles meat and veggies with each bowl containing a ramekin of sweet teriyaki sauce the shrimp in my bowl was perfectly tender and succulent the honey orange sauce sweet but not cloyingly so the bowl came with a lime wedge which added the perfect zing to the mellow coconut rumbi rice we also ordered some of their bahama mamas tortilla soup which was a creamy coconutbased broth filled with chunks of grilled chicken tortilla strips and melty mozzarella it was a good cozy soup but could have benefited from more depthsome tang some spice something for dessert we had some of rumbis key lime piemoist rich and delectably sweet with a lovely measure of sour only complaint the graham cracker crust was too mushy soft and crumbly it would have been much better with a crispy bed under the pillowyness of the key lime filling all in all great place with reasonable prices given their generous portions they have a ton of salad options as well each more inventive than the last and ill be returning to try and test each one
__label__1 this is one excellent ethiopian restaurant rivals anything ive sampled in washington dc or seattle if i lived in phoenix this would be a top5 restaurant for me along with lolos chicken waffles yum lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu many of the entrees are offered as small portions 450600 each they suggest each diner order 23 of these to make a meal kitfo and lamb tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many ethiopian restaurants you can order combo plates meat combo veggie combo house combo plate etc this made deciding on our meal a little more complicated but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes our favorite dish ordered was the lamb tibs the spicy version with awaze spice paste lamb was soooo tender and the spices were a delight rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes good thing it comes as a full order four of us were competing for bites we ordered a half portion of keye wott beef in a spicy brown sauce that was some of the best ive ever had again rich in flavor but not too spicy my favorite ethiopian meat dish is kitfo choice beef sort of like steak tartar servered raw or lightly cooked but with ethiopian spices lalibelas was pretty good just not transcendent like the lamb tibs or beef keye wott the vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent especially the yellow lentils gomen collard greens and spicy wott lentils staff was great attentive helpful service unlike some ethiopian restaurants this one is very userfriendly although in some cases the menu accommodates american tastes it doesnt compromise on quality or authenticity one note on the injera spongelike bread used to scoop up the entrees its a mix of wheat flour and teff a grain indigenous to ethiopia and i dont think its fermented like injera that is made with 100 teff im used to the latter but you can argue lalibelas injera doesnt compete with the flavor of the entrees as much all in all one of the best ethiopian restaurants ive been to and i have been to many in the states only problem now is whether my favorite ethiopian restaurants in seattle will still taste as good highly highly recommended
__label__0 my nephew just moved to scottsdale recently so me and a bunch of friends brought him here to show him a local bar that he and the girlfriend could come shoot pool watch football play volleyball etcwellwe werent there 5minutes and 2 kids were running around the pool tables messing up our games and screaming i couldnt believe the staff was allowing this to happen they were hitting the pool sticks on everything and crying when their mom attempted in vain to quiet them youd think the mom would leave at this point with her kidsumnothe staff did seem annoyed as well but said nothing thenit happenedshe said you guys better behave or mommy will be fired holy shitshe works there even worse shame on that owner for allowing this to happen and that employee needs to recognize thisyou work at a barnot a daycarea bar

__label__0 we arrived at 700 had a party of six and were able to be seated within 15 minutes fabulous considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening but we have always had good luck getting right into grimaldis regardless of the location the new scottsdale quarter location has great ambience and service going for it but i was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza one of the reasons my partner and i keep going back to the old town location is for the consistently tasty crust crisp and thin yet chewy and moist as well our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done by comparison maybe the qc will improve as time goes onim sure well be back to see
__label__1 best greek food i had in arizona and excellent entertainment the dolmas were the best ive had their version of babaganoush was very good and they had many lambbased dishes the entertainment was great live music belly dancing greekstyle fun broken plates and dancing since i had the sampler plate i can tell you that if youre vegan vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that you might not enjoy the food here greek lasagnareally also the chicken was no good but i dont really like chicken anyway
__label__1 i love this place what can i say richard cho not only has some of the best customer service skills i have ever seen that guy has an amazing memory for names but some of the most creative approaches to making sushi in the valley i love coming to sushi eye i have never had a bad experience in all the years i have been going to the 2x new times best of phoenix award winner the use of macadamia nuts is brilliant and an amazing addition to many of the creative rolls that are available the spicy scallop roll is a go to for sure they have and i know this sounds stupid the best california rolls in arizona as pedestrian as that roll is the california roll is transformed in to a very dessert style treat when ordered at sushi eye seriously do it go check it out introduce yourself to richard and be amazed when he remembers your name you will be amazed by the food as well
__label__1 i stumbled in here craving breakfast because it was very close to the airport and very close to the aloft hotel i was staying at yes i am a tourist and yes i am from a part of the us where cowboys are not common so walking into a place full of country western paraphanalia made me smile the service was good the food was delicious and i walked out with a few good photos the coffee was a tad bit weak but im a starbucks bold drinker so i dont hold it against them
__label__1 this place is a dream designer blouses for 1700 seven jeans and hudson jeans for 20 steve madden shoes for 25 i could go on the store is beautiful wellorganized and full of things that are in perfect or nearperfect condition some items are still quite pricey but most of the store is extremely reasonably priced if you need something new very quickly for a date or an interview or a special occasion you will probably find it here the employees are nice friendly helpful and the dressing rooms are good as well love it
__label__1 i stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new the place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve he clearly explained every item i was curious about since the labels were in spanish i asked if his name was miguel and he said yes i told him i read about his bakery on yelp then he said that he loves yelp and thats how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places he was very friendly and had lots of patience i was the only customer at the time and he actually doesnt mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others i ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost 680 what a great deal they also sell other items such as tamales burritos and menudo i inquired about the burritos cuz i like mine with a little kickbut unfortunately they werent ready yet he showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos he said they dont look big but he assured that the burritos are filled with red mild or green with a kick chili shredded pork and some potatoes he said that one burrito is good to fill up a person soi must come back and try it so far ive had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and bavarian creamthe bavarian wasnt as creamy than im used to i almost thought it would have been better off to not have it but its a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the bavarian on its on i had that curvy pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top i thought it might be too sweet but nope it was just fine with the pineapple filling excuse me as i wipe my drool then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar the first bite was eh the second bite wasum third bite wow i finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and i love it did i mention that im not a big fan of caramel this caramel is sweet and creamy its just so good a definitely must have for next time thats about as much my tummy let me eat for today im sure the rest will be just as good and i cant wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies
__label__1 i love guerreros i worked in mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time im a huera but my hispanic pals all rated this place authentic its a husband and wife team that runs it the best thing are the beans incidentally thats how i rate the authenticity of mexican fare they are the kind of beans i ate in nogales during college at a place i could only locate while intoxicated thinner lighter colored and delicious compared to any ive ever had this side of the border i live in pv now super far but after this i think im gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to mesa yum
__label__1 great place to go with out of towners after a downtown game the drinks here are better than the bar food
__label__1 pleasant and beautiful feed the koi fish cheerios bathrooms are out of a catalogi want that walk at a snails pace because its not terribly large when youre done walk down to pita jungle or lola coffee
__label__1 i love this place the more i go to it the service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called mexican gumbo holy schneikies its good cant beat the prices either if i had a choice of this place over chipotle i would choose qdoba any day
__label__1 you may think this is a cop out writing a review of starbucks its like writing a review of water its wet delicious and necessary to my survival my aim is simple here though this particular starbucks location is an excellent place for people watching try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a friday afternoon and tell me you arent entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors while attending school i was taking a screenwriting class and given the arduous task of writing descriptions of about 35 random people where did i go to write every single one of them park central starbucks the crew here is also super friendly every time i come in and they do their best to remember my name it doesnt help that i tell them a different name every time ok thats not true but what a fun social experiment that would make the coffee been there done that and theres not much else i can say about it but for the sport of peoplewatching this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in
__label__1 a few coworkers and i were in town for a conference and decided to check out this place on a tuesday for lunch service was fast and the sandwiches were good the bread was freshi would suggest splitting because a whole sandwich is just too much for a regular appetite
__label__0 dropped by for a manicure and as soon as i sat down my manicurist started talking in rapid vietnamese i couldnt see her headset so i thought she was speaking to me but obviously she wasnt in fact she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure except in confusion when i said i didnt want her to cut my cuticles just push them back she really didnt understand that and asked me in broken english why i was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut she didnt have an attitude about it but was just really confused i think after that exchange she told whoever was on her phone about it i also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place the whole experience was perfunctory but didnt leave me wanting to return for a manicure not asking for a great nail technician but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails and most importantly if she asked whether i wanted them cut round or square because i wanted them round i would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that i didnt see what they looked like
__label__1 beeror yoga located in a small center just east of four peaks brewery in tempe a reasonable distance from the light rail on apache is an amazing classy studio for the mindbody connection mr mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the asu gym that he loved the stretch so pursued a class for a semester at asu this spring and had the pleasure of practicing with tish hegel after seeing his body transform to only 162 body fat all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his american apparel briefs nicely i was super jealous he raved about his teacher and i could tell he had destressed a lot since he started the practice luckily she opened up a studio recently and it simply goregous the waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from workschool not at all cheesy like the southwest inst with the way too many angels imagery creepy but the gem is truly the practice space hardwood floors high ceilings a beautiful staircase tasteful decorations and absolutely no mirrors that is right the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and whoever isnt focusing on their tree posturenot the entire class it really relieves a lot of stress and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks as for tish hegel she is simply outstandingshe has so many credentials you have to read her biography for yourself she has been practicing for a loooong time and her handson instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now bring those shoulders down so far i have done ashtanga inspired flow pretty intense really hurt for 3 days would recommend after getting into yoga for a while sivananda ditto focus class did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybodys body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after and this morning brought my friend to kinetic yoga morning movement and flow which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards she does tons of modifications is always making sure we are okay and is just super personable i did the huge package since i didnt renew my asu gym membership for this summer but you can do dropin now for the cliched yoga review ending namaste
__label__1 my gf and i just tried the oggie bc we werent super hungry even with that the food was super yummy i wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving the sauce that came with the oggie was excellent too so i suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce the decoration in the store is quite unique church pews and wall and table deocrations its a must go if you are around the area
__label__1 came out last night with a few friends the bar was cool but im really not a fan of the crowd in old town the drink prices were not bad but it was a blast dancing outside overall a pretty cool spot
__label__0 just because this place is called maria maria doesnt mean they sell mexican food their menu actually says mexican inspired cuisine which should have been my clue to leave the food is border line nasty the restaurant is cute and sort of romantic but its so loud in there that it ruins the romantic mood i was excited to see they had live music until they started playing some weird pop music why would they do that in a mexican restaurant i wanted to leave but our waitress was no where to be found 20minutes after we finished our meal i dont recommend this place for any meal i have only been living in scottsdale for two months but it seem that arizona is cougar town the bar was full of them im beyond annoyed with all this ladies acting like they are 21 wherever i go im embarrassed for them they dress and act young but with that face and hands who are they kidding besides themselves gee
__label__1 everything was nice the ice cream was delicious no overwhelming alcohol taste an interesting variety of flavors service was fine place was clean ill go back but only because i have a killer sweet tooth and theyre in the neighborhood
__label__1 smaller than the chandler location but definitely a great place to find bargains come here prepared to do a bit of digging especially in the shoe section and expect to wait in line
__label__1 brand spankin newcustomer service with a smile good selection good prices friendly customer service bought some stuff to make the house better garage door opener some hooks to finally hang that darn 65 x 78 painting up nothing at all like home depot either i found the fixtures for kitchen improvements here to be of higher quality as well thumbs up from meplus its so close to the house not sure if thats a good or a bad thing time will tell
__label__1 bacon people spicy italian sausages brats even heirloom veggies by the pound locally raised hogs and none of the extra chemicals the corporations and grocery stores use i have found my personal piggy promised land and it is the meat shop i headed over here with some buddies after hearing that some local restaurants and patrons have been taking notice of the flavor and quality they offer we were quite pleased the staff were helpful and knowledgeable about the meats cuts and preparation we grilled up everything that night the sausages the brats the veggies even the bacon because why not i think we spent a grand total of 20 and we still had enough leftovers to throw in with some sunny side up eggs and toast the next morning for breakfast this place is fantastic and surprisingly the same cost as most of the stuff youll find in the grocery store i cant wait to head back over for round 2

__label__0 i just moved to the area so use yelp but was very sad that the experience here was not worth making a return visit the only reason i am posting is because it has not been reviewed in so long i did not like how the spa pedicure was one price and then things you would expect in a spa pedicure was upgrades i want to ask for a pedicure and then lay back enjoy the chair and some reading after the pedicure the woman left me in the chair for my nails to dry and think she completely forgot about me i would have left if she had put my flip flops on before painting my nails their child was cute but i do not go to get a pedicure to play games with other peoples children then to top it off when i paid she asked for my pin as she was walking away againno pin it was a credit cardusually this would not bother me but i was already frustrated at this point
__label__1 i used to go here about once a week when i still lived and worked in arizona my office at the time was within walking distance this is a very good hooters locationlocated smack dab in the middle of mill avenue right next to asu plenty of stores all around i used to go mainly for lunches during the week with coworkers it usually was quieter than evenings or weekends the serving staff were great and many of the ladies would stand and chat for quite a whileas it was pretty slow
__label__1 i dont think there is anything else to be said about delux its been around and they offer nothing but great food the classic burger and the delux burger are both very delicious i like delux better and i do recommend medium rare the quality of the meat is unbelievable love the sweet fries i do prefer the mixture of both sweet and regular fries
__label__1 great setting to enjoy good food
__label__0 horrible service barely acknowledged when you first walked in slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself will not come again
__label__1 yes its on the northwest side and its tucked into a nondescript strip mall better known for being the home of padre murphys sports bar but dont let appearances fool you this is a great gym the gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment weight machines free weights and group exercise classes it also has a pool hot tub sauna and steam room but will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility it has video games popashot and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much they are begging to go to the gym and its a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the northwest side
__label__1 impressed stopped 2 x before and the wait was to long made reservations for 5 this time friends had recommened and raved about becketts and had this on the short list for awhile it was everything as advertised ambiance very casual good food excellent service adria was very good and made good recommendations and fair prices recommend the osso bucco pork but not a bad meal by the group sunday is az winery special which is a nice touch must try the pimms cup cocktail excellent cant wait to go back
__label__1 cheesy beefy greasy greatness the burgers are made as you watch sit at the bar and watch the grill cook who also is the server bartender and cashier grab a nice fat ball of ground and pound it out on the grill to make your one of a kind patty next comes the wine onto the grill and the patty which gives the place its name finish it off with a fat layers of veggis pair this with some jalapeno bottle caps and a pint of draft and your in business dont mind the dingy early 70s decorit is character the only negativeyou will be jogging for weeks to drop those caloriesa very guilty pleasure
__label__1 this is my go to place when i want a cheap quick meal without having to get fast food they have healthy options and use fresh flavorful ingredients their portion sizes are generous and the staff is always nice and friendly my favorite is the greek salad wgryo meat the dressing is awesome im also a fan of the platters and spanakopita
__label__1 holy crap try the side order of garlic mushrooms they are little pieces of heaven that are such a delight to pop in your mouth also on the special menu right now theres a salad called the mediteranian chicken salad which really truly may be the most incredible salad ive ever eaten in my life i wish i could drink the dressing that topped the impressive mix of greens corn roasted red peppers cilantro raisins pine nuts red onions parsley wellseasoned chicken and i cant remember the rest omg beautiful service was fine not exceptional but the staff was friendly enough im so happy i found this place go there
__label__0 this place is the perfect example of a tourist trap nice location not far of the main drag of old scottsdale beautiful building and layout the margaritas are good but probably 23 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles i thought paying 5 for chips and salsa was a ripoff but then when the chips tasted stale i was even less happy cmon if you have tortilla and factory in your name you ought to have fresh chips i thought the tortillas themselves were okay not great but okay the carne fuego or whatever i had the waitress recommended was not good small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweethot sauce the veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potatostuffed chile was weird it couldve been great but it was nowhere near good unless your aunt hattie who has never had mexican food is in town from ohio id skip this place altogether
__label__0 to sum it up this place was just not the place for me maybe i am just a fuddy duddy but it seems that the clientele are cougarlike women aged 3050 with bleached hair and sequin tops i expected a quiet wine bar but instead it is more like a loud night club the hubby and i visited the living room on a saturday night so maybe the whole wewishwewereaclub thing was just a once a week occurrence and maybe just maybe i am totally uncool but we dont plan to return food wine specials were fairly decent and priced well food was average 3 stars we had a variety of bruschetta a tuna salad and a strawberry salad way too much dressing on both salads service it took a long time to get a table 30 mins but it was saturday night and crowded so expected once seated our waitress seemed more concerned with anything other than serving us she was not very attentive at all she asked for my order and walked away my husband was like uh i kind of want to order too atmosphere the overall look and feel of the place is pretty neat it is a smaller restaurant with lots of patiooutdoor seating decor is large heavy curtains and many couches thus the name the living room however as i mentioned earlier the music was ridiculously loud they had a dj playing music so loud having a conversation was impossible and we ended up sitting pretty far from the speakers we left a soon as we finished our dinners didnt stay for more wine or dessert because the music was just too annoying
__label__1 great to see a total wine closer to where i live large selection and decent prices used the 10 off coupon from the newspaper to buy a nice napa cab this afternoon
__label__1 loved the room and its functionality but this same room made me want to punch myself in the face im a young professional in his mid 30s who likes to party and understands what the w brand provides especially on the weekends during moneymaker time but when their dj on saturday night sounds like hes spinning from your bathroom it makes for a tough stay got home at 1230 a little buzzed and had a rave in my head until 2am finally got to sleep and loved the room and hotel otherwise but this will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth maybe its just a few rooms but 205 is a bad number here
__label__1 i went to this place the night before my birthday after making 3 uturns and kturnafter reading all the good reviews about this place i expected to see a lighted up sign at the least to make the average driver realize where to turnother than that it was great food looks can be deceiving looks like a rundown cafeteria but the food was amazing the bbq beef brisket were tender and melt in your mouth the pork ribs was delicious the family size cole slaw was ridiculously small i thought i was in france ordering es cargo but overall good food
__label__1 i dont drink a lot of coffee but im a fan of tea especially strange tea that i probably cant pronounce right oh and i like it when it smells like scotch yep im a fan of lapsang souchong but im not a fan of foofy and thats one thing that tea infusion is not its not foofy its funky its fun and everyone who works there is really friendly beyond the teas the food is good too i dont know that id eat there every night but its a wider variety than id expect at a tea place this is a regular stop of mine makes tempe markeplace worth it
__label__1 this is a really good starbucks location unlike a lot of the newer locations that have retro plastic chairs that look much more stylish than functional it has lots of comfy upholstered chairs plenty of plugs for web surfers and a decentlysized outdoor seating area the staff is really friendly and efficient as well there is also a drivethrough
__label__0 i needed an oil change reeeeaaaally badly i know but i have a honda and those things can run on gas fumes for 30 miles and oil resin for months and had had an ok experience at the dannys family on highland free wash with a oil change who doesnt love that but i checked the dannys site and saw no promotion of the wash and didnt want to drive out of my way for nothing i checked yelp and this jiffy lube had the best rating i could expect for an oil change place and was up the road from work downloaded the coupon thanks for the tip kym and was on my way pull in and i tell the guy i want the signature change which includes window wash and floor vacuum mentioning my 5 off coupon he said that they were already running a special that was 13 off the 35 price so i said aok cowboy i wait for about 810 minutes in the small waiting room bonus for having a phoenix magazine in the stack of muscle car monthly oil today and antennas weekly look just because im getting routine maintenance on my car does not mean im into cars i get pulled into the garage area for the spiel everybody dreads but it was surprisingly short and nonpushy im glad they dont drag you over to your engine anymore thats totally lame i do have to note that he tried to tell me my right front blinker my left back blinker and my license plate lights were out i had just gone to checker to replace my left front blinker light and went through some extensive light checking and so found this news odd i kept saying as much and he kept insisting and i was about to ask to see for myself when he calls out to another worker hey was that the honda with the lights or the jeep the other guy says the jeep however there was no other car in the place hmmmmmmmm ok so i pay up 24 altogether with a tax or fee or something added in and go back into the waiting area while they finish up i decide to use the bathroom and this is where the they lost two stars this was up until then quite possibly a fourstar experience wait two stars for a bathroom you ask oh you just wait the bathroom was filthiest thing i have seen in my life and ive been to some raunch truck stop pee holes literally piss in the bowl i get in closer and i shit you not pun intended four shit smears in the bowl as well yeah i counted two rolls of tp hanging out on top of the dispenser each with one square left on them realizing i need to sterilize my hands from just walking into this mess i discover no soap or paper towels not very surprising as well hair clippings all over the sink like the guys are trimming their moustaches on their break unfreakingbelievable i am still haunted by this bathroom experience but cars running great
__label__1 totts is this amazing little neighborhood asian restaurant that has quickly become a favorite of mine the simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky the service is very friendly and helpful they are always smiling and it actually seems sincere this is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables there is a nice little patio as well there are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order 1 fill your cup with your beverege of choice soft drinks and tea only no alcohol hence only 4 stars do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that wayand i do and because i am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough i grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the hot chili paste to bring to my table you can of course choose chopsticks or a fork i usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks i pretend i know exactly what i am doing but these never work as i cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so i end up with at least 1 fork i am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table i barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming hot korean with black bean sauce and tofu or the yellow curry panang also with tofu you can aslo get chicken beef or fish the meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places the vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees faces i must also confess my longing for pf changs or pei wei has certainly diminished after discovering totts totts even has excellent won ton soup now if they could only get a beer and wine license
__label__1 a great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain we have been going to tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love there are plenty of tvs for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts
__label__1 i am so sorry i didnt come here sooner this is a great sports bar not far from our house the service was very friendly and the killer wings they also have honey bbq were awesome they had tons of meat on them which isnt always the case with wings as i am sure most of you can attest we also had the margherita pizza which was pretty tasty there were numerous tvs scattered throughout the restaurant and they had 1 beers yes 1 when we were there fantastic deal this place is definitely more chill than fox sports grill not quite as fancy or upscale but its a perfect sports watching or beer drinking venue nonetheless oh and they deliver good choice if you live in north scottsdale
__label__1 had an opportunity to take our canadian guests to aiellos for supper on the weekend it was a a moderate drive but we were not disappointed we were rewarded with pleasant surroundings attentive service and good food the complementary hot pepper starter was unusual and tasty when coupled with the fresh bread the mushroom ravioli special was especially enjoyed by my spouse and the other entrees brought favorable reviews from our guests all in all an enjoyable dining experience
__label__0 water park is ok however the parking lot has zero security no security patrols no cameras my catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at big surf tempe today sawed right off in broad daylight according to the cops car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here beware the water park management doesnt give a shit even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing our camera is broken but its getting fixed next week what a joke if you go have someone drop you off youve been warned
__label__1 always consistent quality and value we have been regulars of pappadeaux in our previous home of tx and we still are big fans
__label__1 first and most importantly every person ive met at qc vet clinic has been super they are caring and wonderful with my dogs they are never too busy to smile and give great service when i come through the door they have even taken time to share stories and pictures of their own pets second they understand that some people must take a fiscally conservative approach with the care of their pets they discussed all options thoroughly with me and i performed the care that was needed a little at a time as it was needed this was important to me since many vets that weve visited in the past have handed us an estimate for hundreds or thousands of dollars and wouldnt budge insisting that we had to do all the work listed at qc vet clinic i didnt feel like i was judged for that decision unfortunately we had a small mistake that i discussed with the vet she listened and gave appropriate feedback to my concerns this is really the only thing that is preventing a 5 star rating overall they are still the best vet ive visited and i will continue to put my pets lives in their very capable hands btw we had to have a pet put down because he was ill the team at qc vet clinic was absolutely the best they were so empathetic and even sent us a sympathy card with a little surprise inside i wont give it away but it was so very special to my family its the little things in life that fill our heartsthanks qc vet clinic
__label__0 i have to admit the quality of food here is better than your average bertos restaurant however the girl who works the drivethrough during the late shift makes some of the strangest mistakes with the food warning if your ordering 2 items dont be surprised to find them in one box combined into some strange hybrid i honestly dont think she understands the word and this has happened to me several times int the last month always make sure to check your order here
__label__1 even though there are only two things on the menu that i can eat theyre damned tasty and the service is incredibly fast i am a bit surprised by all the five stars though you people do realize that this is just a chain sandwich joint right
__label__1 45 stars the seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good very expensive much better experience than the ocean club in newport beach
__label__0 slow service staff needs more training theres like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing i dont think this place is going to make it sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons saturday night because of your poor customer service
__label__1 every time i visit arizona i love to eat here to food is vary good and i have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant i wish they would have some in georgia
__label__1 yay i got to try the happy hour finally they even had a sweet band playing in the dinning room great ambiance on 4th of july weekend the girls and i got a room at the valley ho and ventured over to vics for some much need food around happy hour time the fun drinks were totally wroth it i got the burger on the hh menu it was sooo yummy huge and came with a bunch of fries and was only 3 crazy right we were pretty tired so we couldnt stay long but next time i want to try the calamari hummus and other fun drinks
__label__1 in the interest of full disclosure the only thing i every really go here for is the lunch buffet but wow what a great buffet i believe the buffet itself is about 10 and for that you get a wide range of vegetarian items and as with other items on the buffet most of those get changed out over time so you get a rotation of various dishes as you come back they also have hummus and baba ghanoush like hummus but made with eggplant instead of chickpeas there is generally at least one dish with red meat today it was a tomato based stew with eggplant and either beef or lamb and usually two dishes with chicken i generally get iced tea to go with the meal and one thing to note they do not serve alcohol so if you want to go someplace where you can also have a drink or two this would not be a good place to go but if you just want a place with really good middle eastern food the owners told me it is really lebanese cooking but im going to just generalize and say for most of us when you try it you will think middle eastern of course you can walk a block or two to 4 peaks brewery in the same area and have a drink or two before or after you your meal one really nice thing about this place it is right off the apache stop on the light rail and right across the road same side of the street is pita jungle so a wide range of good food options right off that light rail stop bottom line ive never had anyone ive taken here not like it and everyone who has gone has wanted to go back again i like it for lunch during the workday because it is quick and you have a wide variety of regularly changed out tasty food options so i recommend you give it a try if you have the time
__label__1 i really love this place im not sure why there are so many mixed reviews maybe what they ordered i always get the regular size custom burger blue cheese mayo lettuce tomato and sometimes bacon simple and delicious the rosemary fries with smash sauce are also amazing the only thing i didnt care for were the fried pickles a bit too salty
__label__1 agree with the previous review something nice about this super target leaving a review to back up the other my only gripe is i spend to much at targer or my wife does anyway
__label__1 i very much enjoy this place the duck sandwich has changed my life the brick oven gives the pizza a natural full flavor homemade style taste that makes you slow down and enjoy every bite the atmosphere the set up and the bar is all very welcoming and very clean hard to spot when you are driving down the road i have been there about 10 times and i still pass it up sometimes parking is not the best and valet is not really needed but they very much have top shelf alcohol and delicious food to boot not extremely expensive either but pricey enough to make you count your bills before you enter just so you will have enough great place
__label__1 i love this place and eat there every time im in the area pizza pasta appetizers all fantastic plan to spend some time waiting for a table we always have fun just eating at the bar yumm
__label__1 a prospective customer at sakana must check out the customer appreciation sushi roll menu before ordering from the main menu customer appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most japanese restaurants in california and tastes just as good if not better 7 for 5 large cuts of hamachi sashimi add 2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven the ikura at this restaurant are the best i have ever tasted anywhere beers for as afforadable as 325 sodas with free refills for 195 can you find this quality at these prices in scottsdale i didnt think so
__label__1 drop what youre doing and drive here after i ate here i had to go back the next day for more the food is that good this cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if i hadnt been driving down palm rd to avoid construction while waiting to turn onto 16th street the grand opening sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy a new place to try it looked desolate from the outside but when i opened the door i was put at easy by the decor smell and cleanliness inside i ordered dinner for two to go the menu was awesome i loved seeing all the variety poblano peppers mole mahi mahi mushroomssomething wrapped in banana leaves it made it difficult to choose something heres what ive had so far la condesa shrimp burro and baja sur dogfish shark taco they are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show so much flavor i snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros mmmm such a delight the salsa bar is endless i really stocked up i was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot in fact it all was but im a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers the horchata is handmade and delicious they throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus as if the good food wasnt enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did im a sucker for mexican folk art and frida kahlo is my oprah theres a painting of her and diego hanging over the salsa bar its amazing all the paintings are great love the artist
__label__1 yeah its bbbwhat else to say
__label__0 this place is the whitetrash chipotle the food is mediocre at best i mean seriously how can you just up and steal chipotles idea theres no creativity there the habenaro salsa is flavorless and not hot at all seriously i asked for hot not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who cant handle real salsa at least chipotle has hot salsa not too hot either but much better for a fast americanized mexican food of course i much rather have the real deal but i do like chiptole for what it is not this crap that qdoba tries to serve up the chicken is over seasoned and highly spicedherbed you can barely taste the chicken the fajita veggie were the same the product looked of very low quality oxidizing guacamole and lettuce the meat looked unappetizing as well just not at the level of chipotle although i have been here twice this is the last time for me i have been to one in denver and for some reason thought it was better so maybe its management but i can say the food is less than good i much rather go to chiptole than this wannabe employees were dumber than a bag of frijoles this place has the worst mexican food i have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 711 or a burrito from taco bell just disgusting food
__label__0 jimmy johns is cheaper and better the capriotti food is heavy and it doesnt taste as good as you think it should taste
__label__0 heed the negative reviews this restaurant can be summed up in two words mediocre overpriced i wish i had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews the positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in however much to my disappointment one spring roll is 450 although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid 350 which was still too much in my opinion they were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor and we tried 3 different kinds the peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls i had the lemon grass chicken for dinner the chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet i couldnt detect even a hint of the lemon grass the presentation was unappetizing with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles im not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didnt want to be negative but neither of them made any positive comments about their food as i said pay attention to the negative reviews if you like bland overpriced food you may like this place but otherwise i cant see anyone going back for more
__label__1 absolutely adore this restaurant amazing location and such a great food been going there for a long long time i have yet be even slightly annoyed bliss they wait on you hand and foot food presentation and taste is fantasticalways make you feel very special the hostesses are not rude nor snooty and are always smiling great managers love them all around and i am super picky and proud of it do it go there 1 rest per me in az for beautiful location and food
__label__1 culvers is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out i believe they have several stores now here in the valley the root beer is a must as well as the butter burgers cheese curds frys frozen custurdlol the list goes on i have not found anything as of yet that i did not enjoy
__label__0 this place could be great and ive always wanted to like it more than i actually do occasionally i have stopped into mills end for breakfast specifically because they have crepes on their menu in fact their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe for reasons explained below lately ive found myself just walking past mills end no longer considering giving it my business the general issues that i have with this place involve just a couple of basic things if the owners made the effort to correct these i believe mills end could be a great cafe i have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors it is with all three of these that mills end falls short 1ambience this means that the environment must be suitable both for studyingreading as well as relaxation so the music playing needs to be something that is nonintrusive and that the customers can generally ignore sometimes mills end has this covered but other times not at all onto the seating it seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995 in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the tv show friends unfortunately they didnt come close but there is usually plenty of seating open by the way what is up with pseudosexual ice photography on the walls 2price this is actually my number one problem with mills end the coffee is reasonably priced but the food is too expensive anytime i tell someone that i ate there its always the same response yeah their food is good but its really pricey considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop i imagine that their business has gone up but those prices sure havent dropped 3customer service the staff has always been just lukewarm look i dont expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time i only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality this has just always been kind of lacking at mills end honestly i think this place has a lot of potential but it seems to be awash in complacency
__label__0 this place needs to close their doors get their act together and then reopen the atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant the food is horribly boring and has no flavor i ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing we also got the nachos which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef in addition the server didnt put in my order for my pizza hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating one of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone elses special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well the only thing i liked was the beer and that too took forever and i had to remind my server several times to get me a refill way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best
__label__1 took my daughter to mendys place 4 times treatments doctors nurses and other staff were great my complaint is that the er physicians are not innetwork participating with most insurance companies even though the hospital is participating the physicians are not thus resulting in larger physician bills us consumers pay dearly for our health insurance i dont like being overcharged by greedy physicians
__label__0 been there done that fair sandwiches better than safeway anyway only 2 stars since i didnt know about the free soft serve so didnt get to try that theres gotta be a good new yorkstyle deli west of the 17 and north of thunderbird isnt there doesnt have to be great good would be wonderful
__label__1 we went to central grille on thanksgiving for their buffet good food excellent service and very nice ambiance we asked to sit outside and the weather was great for it great place to sit back relax and enjoy some food while i didnt drink they had a pretty good wine and beer list i will go back enjoyed the experience
__label__1 i love chic nails i used to go to tip toes on 48th street and ray road until one day they were too busy to take my friend and i in for pedicured we discovered chic nails and have been doing all of our manicures and pedicures there since the staff is extremely friendly and they give the best pedicures for a very reasonable price i highly recommend this nail salon over any other ps it is extremely close to cks bar grill to go for happy hour after
__label__1 do not bother going anywhere else this is the place to go for laser no contracts easy to get appointments very reasonable the staff is fantastic every one of them i usually go to kristen but all others are as equally friendly and competent location is very convenient also i have looked and i have received many groupon and living social offers from other places but i never bothered this is the one
__label__1 ive been here twice and my favorite item has been their version of tiramisu its not soaked in espresso or whatever the local italian eateries are using these daysits made with champagne its light and fluffyits like eating a cloud from heaven very much a date place it has a romantic atmosphere so dont go there if youre not trying to give off that vibe otherwise great for a group setting oh and for any potential cougars the waitstaff is delicious eye candy
__label__1 ate here twice while staying at the biltmore ordered the breakfast buffet and bloody mary the first day which would warrant 3 stars basic buffet with sausages bacon eggs potatoes french toast omelet station and desserts omelet station was one of the better ones ive had but everything else was average bloody mary had cheese shrimp and some other things on it and was quite tasty on the second visit we had the lunch special which was chicken salad served in a tomato bowl and a pizza the chicken salad sounds very simple but was extremely delicious the pizza was one of the best ive had in a long time id definitely order the pizza again
__label__1 i used to frequent this restaurant years and years ago i was a student at the deer valley airport and eventually a flight instructor as well it was a great location with awesome views the food was always descent the the service was great nothing too exciting but a great place
__label__1 open late that is a huge plus been here for lunch and for dinner also in different times of the year service is always stellar food is always good sometimes there is something weird with the check such as charging for things that were supposed to be included or full price for happy hour items or something like that not sure why that keeps happening there seems to be some pressure on the staff otherwise the place is trendy and seems small and loud in the busy times spacious and accommodating when just the right amount of people best time is dinner in a booth not on a weekend and when you are really hungry as the food portions are generous
__label__1 huge store friendly staff
__label__1 i really want to rate the place higher i like what its all about instead of pulling the building down and rebuilding something in that space it has been converted to a community space i went to see one of their cult classics and the staff was ok it was completely amateur hour i guess thats ok for the type of movie etc the problem was this was a sold out movie and the staff brought in folding chairs to sit on to watch that would have been ok before the movie started but ithey did it one at a time making noise for the first 30 minutes of the movie clanging whispering etc then they kept getting up and down they seating was pretty bad low seats that reclined normally thats ok but theres usually some spring to it these had no support at all halfway through my back was hurting and would have to readjust but there was no comfortable way to sit in the chairs
__label__1 just had my first hot dog at short leash dogs and quite honestly i cant call it a hot dog because that just conjures up images of well a hot dog and short leash dogs are so much more and better than a hot dog the way most people know hot dogs know what i mean no well go have a short leash dog really unique combinations various dog options all local meats and produce bratwurst beer hot veggie my friend and i shared an aiko we chose the brat as our dog with mango chutney red onions cilantro mayo and jalapeño on a naan you might have read that in other reviews no traditional buns here you can find the short leash dogs truck at the phoenix public market on wednesday evenings and saturday mornings and if you follow them on twitter shortleashdogs you can find out whenwhere else they make regular stops scottsdale central phoenix track em down and eat their food and talk to them brad and kat are smart enthusiastic folks with a great sense of humor and offer superb food and service whats not to love
__label__1 this is the best hit or miss bargain spot for everything i frequently find great deals on quality body care products be sure you know how to read the labels theres a lot of low quality products in the mix designer sun glasses shoes clothing housewares baby shower gifts pet gifts and guy gifts it seems i go at peak hours where lines are incredibly long i see it as a small price for macys quality at a walmart price
__label__0 the beer is good most of the food is ok but i have a big issue with bjs they advertise their pizza as chicago style deep dish when you order one youll know right away why there isnt a single location of this chain in illinois the pizza is more like something id expect to have ordered at pizza hut than anything ive had growing up in chicago have a beer here before seeing a movie next door other than that theres way better places to eat in and around chandler fashion center mall
__label__1 bit over priced but theyre tea is to die for
__label__1 nestled between the bright lights of the once famous graham central station and a noname bbq place is a lovely gem i like to refer to as skips the bar side of this place is nothing too special dont get me wrong its big for a bar but the ambiance and furniture are pretty dated so unless you enjoy playing pool i dont know why you would want to come here that being said the pool here is great they just got around 15 brand new diamond 7 tables which play awesome their 9 tables also play well but they have some pretty unforgiving pockets so if you are a beginner i wouldnt play on the big tables unless you like to be frustrated they have no house cues on the floor you have to rent them up at the bar for 100 this is great because they can maintain a better quality cue for you if you use house cues their food is actually really good ive had their turkey burger which was moist and delicious it comes with a nicely sized basket of fries also their nachos are ridiculous good thats saying a lot coming from me the only bad thing about their nachos is that they use that liquid fake cheese i prefer shredded blends on my nachos the waitresses there are uber friendly yes uber they always make a point to remember your name and they are always sooo busy make sure to tip them well they will remember you wednesday night is league night there so unless you want to watch avoid wednesday from 710pm oh and hh is from 27 and lots of the food including the nachos and turkey burger are priced to sell go shoot some pool
__label__1 this place had amazing food for reasonable prices they have tiny card games at the tables which was pretty neat too it keeps you busy while you wait for your food the bar was neat and the atmosphere was ok i did not enjoy the music and it was too loud to ignore the service was pretty good but the waitress made my friends and i uncomfortable like we shouldnt have been there it might have just been that one particular girl and i would still go back dont dress too casual
__label__0 this wendys is terrible i grew up going to wendys but recently the whole chain has become disgusting this one is just a slow disgusting chain blah rather eat pretty much any where else
__label__1 mid size american airport with very good organization very straight forward no hassle security is a little slow and priority lane isnt really priority its more of lets make fun of first class flyers getting pissed lane so lets welcome first class flyers with big giggle many stores and food quality is okay seating areas are limited at least for the terminal 3 before security so be aware lots of volunteers working here to guide you to the right place there may be more volunteers than passengers haha
__label__0 this review is based on delivery service and food quality as delivered second and last time i will be ordering from this place the first time they forgot a few items and were very off for delivery time tonight i ordered at 1103 pm estimated delivery at 1150 updated to 1154 pm from a whopping 15 miles away to add 1154 comes and goes call them at 1207 am now i am told they are on their way 15 miles away keep in mind call back at 1240 am to cancel my order as i do not want to eat at 100 am they actually come to deliver while i am on hold waiting at 1244 am my hot sub is ice cold theres nothing like the taste of cold greasy bacon and chicken close to 100 am on a monday now tuesday nightif you are going to take nearly 2 hours to deliver this at least make sure the temperature is somewhat close to where it is supposed to benever again silver minenever again this place probably has a good taste potential unfortunately like most hot food the taste quality substantially decreases the longer it sitsin a fridge alley or wherever they decided to leave it for nearly 2 hours if you feel the need to get food from herefor the love of sub kings please just dont get delivery
__label__1 my wife and i ate here when we were in town for the bj auto auction the food was good and affordable we liked the fact that they had a full bar and we were able to have a couple of tasty margaritas staff was friendly overall we had a good dining experience
__label__1 the coffee at this location is awful please go get lessons from the lady at the thunderbird and 40th street location however the primary morning guy shawn is awesome he is friendly and chipper but not so much so that hes annoying as your first human contact of the day he is generous with the toppings and speedy
__label__1 this was my first time here it was a nice experience and i found that i really like indian food good stuff
__label__1 my house has never been this clean ever i am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism expressed by the women who cleaned my house today i bought a living social coupon and i am so glad i found this company 5 women arrived and fully cleaned my house in 45 minutes the women were friendly to me and especially my dog which is the sign of a wonderful company if you ask me i am hoping i am able to use this service on a monthly basis angela scheduled my appointment immediately when i let her know i had company coming in town and the cleaners arrived during the scheduled time i am thrilled with the results
__label__1 i made it to china king at 240 pm on a sunday and i called ahead expressing a desire to have a late dim sum lunch however once we arrived they only had a five items to try i was bummed but i will make sure i go early next time so i can here what everyone raves about my average singapore vermicelli was a poor substitute but i will arrive earlier next week so i dont interrupt staff meal that seemed to be the focus when we there as service was neglectful and quite indifferent also i found a hair in my food but why complain when they really dont care if youre there or not
__label__1 fantastic experience from valet to dessert boyfriend and i were both very impressed we were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices cheese trio platter was sooooo good ill be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share i had the beet salad which was very good love the candied walnuts in it boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect tender juicy and delicious the breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh even the coffee was good its very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but i think weve found it service was fantastic our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered could it be possible i cant find anything to criticize i cant love this place
__label__1 what else can i say that hasnt been said already im weirdly glad that theyre not closer in fact very far away from me because ill be there every day gaining tons of weight my baby loved the mango lassi flavor so much he did the sign for more for the first time at the store i do want to try the bacon flavorso a trip soon is in order
__label__1 i really dont consider myself a neimans type of girl as a matter of fact i dont really feel comfortable in neimans its extremely fancy and high end for me but ive gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at neimans in the past i admit the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing anyways i felt some major pressure to register at neimans from my mom so i met my motherinlawtobe at this neimans location on sunday the housewares registry department is extremely small and although the woman working was sweet she botched the spelling of jareds name in the process needless to say i was not so impressed fancy sums this department store up in my eyes im much more of a nordstroms or macys or bloomingdales type of girl
__label__1 just moved to az and this is my local petco everyones really helpful and friendly we just took our dogs here to get groomed and they came back smelling fresh and looking clean
__label__1 i have been going to salon mila for 12 years i will never go anywhere else my hair always looks amazing when i leave the color and cut are always perfect i feel glamorous and beautiful when i leave first class salon beautiful surroundings always great service they aim to please mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time thanks everyone
__label__1 i have lived all over the us and i have experienced extreme lows and highs with dentists but this dental group is by far my favorite i have ever been a patient of i cant say enough good about them so i wont ramble just love them
__label__1 potbelly you have been handed the torch it was a good ride jimmy johns but you have no locations close to my newly purchased home its not you its me i promise i love italianstyle subs the wreck at potbelly is fantastic the wreck salad is also great for a salad this place is my new go to sub shack
__label__1 i honestly feel a bit bad giving wildflower a three star rating but im honestly waiting for the time when i feel impressed with their food ive been to wildflower quite a few times ordering something different each time first time was the sweet potato and fig sandwich disaster next time with the blt plus ick next time was potato soup eh i dont know what my problem is everyone raves about this place as being awesome the nice thing about this location is that i can meet friends here for a mediocre lunch and walk to the movie theatre or target afterwords
__label__0 went here for the first time a few weeks ago the owner was snoring when i walked in so that was odd and kind of a turn off their regular manicures are cheap 10 but the experience overall was soso it got busier as my manicure was going on so it got a little better parking is pretty badthey have approx 3 spaces manicure was finehave a range of opi but all their polishes were jumbled together which i hate overall for a few dollars more there are better places even down the street
__label__1 gymboree many years ago i brought my first son to gymboree quite often and really enjoyed never thought i would be back but now we have another gymboree tike and he loves it i am very happy to have been reintroduced to gymboree and have already made plans to go again with my son next week the instructor made it look easy and really communicated very well with both parents and children thinking about gymboree now my only regret is that i know someday my boy is going to outgrow it and i want these times to last forever
__label__1 this place is pretty good for a chain and its very easy to find something for everyone here the staff has always been friendly and the menu is huge the food is just okay though would return with friends or for convenience but we would not go on our own
__label__1 place is ok im just not a big fan of what they have to offer its funny reading some of the complaints people get a grip food is good place is a cafe style so your service is really up to you cookies are really good my wife enjoys their sandwiches
__label__1 my guy and i decided to try this new salon that just opened a couple months ago the man and woman working there are so friendly we were chatting the whole time as soon as we sat down they offered l us water the chairs are great and the water color changes as you sit there kinda cool the pedicure includes a hot lotion and rock message that is awesome great place we will be back
__label__1 this is a great thai food restaurant my husband and i have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food as well as the service we usually order a few curries and of course the pad thai the food is always consistently good good thai food is sometimes hard to find you definitely wont be disappointed here
__label__1 brought my car in to get the electric stuff checked 25 to do an electronic systems check then determined it was a bad alternator i brought my car in at the end of the day about 5pm or so and they had it ready by 11am the next day the ownermanager terry seemed like a straight up guy pricing is fair as far as i could tell they seem to stay pretty busy with normal cars as well as business fleet vehicles ive seen school buses there topkicksized trucks and as well as your standard fare trucks with lawnmowers on the back
__label__1 excellent atmosphere eclectic menu and reasonable prices welcome to the parlor pizza seems to be their specialty but the menu offers so much more friends swear by the duck club sandwich and my wife loves the sausage pizza if you visit during peak times expect a wait but head to the bar for a drink until your table is ready staff is super friendly our server forgot to deliver apps we ordered and made it right by providing free apps equal value for our next visit he was apologetic and owned up to the mistake he simply forgot to add to computer it happens but he handled it well ill be back
__label__1 really pulled a douche bag move by coming here at 945pm when they close at 1000 but everything was closed except for fast food places in which we didnt feel in the mood for the hostess didnt give us any attitude and sat usit was super dark but had comfy booths andy was our waiter and he had such a great attitude we apologized for coming in so late but he assured us that we were fine the salad was good but kind of small the buttery croissant that accompanied it however is tasty hubs got porkchops and i got the chicken soup not bad we ended up talking and laughing with andy about the restaurant industrytoo bad the bar was closed i wanted to see if he wanted to drink with us
__label__1 way old school i did the lunch buffet 6 and change including drink it was actually pretty good yes there were a few times i asked myself exactly what part of a chicken is this from but the flavors were good im guessing about 15 different items on the buffet im guessing this place has been here for 10 years maybe double that red cheesy asian interior as you would expect in a place like this i like this place so what are you going to do about it
__label__1 35 stars fast friendly service and the food was good i ordered hung pao rice bowl while it was not huge and loaded with things it was plenty for a lunch size the food tasted good we ordered it sunday evening for dinner orange chicken general tso chicken and chicken fried rice all with white meat while i really like the fact you can get all white meat it was a little dry perhaps the way it was sliced and not in small cubes all the food was good but not the best i have had i would order again
__label__1 i always have fun here i went here on new years this year and had a good time i did see the most pathetic lesbian here she wore her make up and dressed just ike the shane character in the lword al i could think was wow what a loser and i wish i was that skinny do you have no personality that you wear a costume everyday so i was with my girlfriend in line and we were holding each other she walked away for five seconds and asked my girlfriend for her number my girlfriend totally dissed her i walked up and you could see the fear in her eye she just kept saying sorry sorry sorry well anyway aside from that i like this place but dont go in the bathroom unless you have to there are always trannys doing coke or k in the womens bathroom make sure and use a tissue to lock and unlock the stall

__label__1 the good really good burger good fries the bad terrible paint and lighting cant even hang out for long maybe that is the idea dont like high booth stalls much jmho of course also a note to the sewage smell that others noted that little area on that side of the mall has smelled like hell for years for some odd reason it sucks for the businesses but i assure you it has nothing to do with smashburger alone nor should it cause any health concerns just luck of the draw on a bad sewer vent problem update 41810 went again really very good decor is still not my fav but the food is solid like i said it is the juiciest burger i have had in a while shoestring fries are kill upped from 3 stars to four
__label__0 i went to noca about a month after is opened and was wowed i told all my fellow foodies about my wonderful experience the innovative menu and all the little extras that made the meal a really special dining experience in phoenix i went back with friends twice after in the coming months and was pleased each time i just went back this past saturday though and would have to say i would no longer suggest it for a special night out it was as if the magic was gone and that the place was showing its age and loosing its specialness it was really just ok the chefs talent shows but too many other let downs when we arrived for our 830 reservation the place was crowded the host was friendly and told us that our table would be ready soon and it was we sat down at our table and thats when things started turning out not as well as expected seated in a back cornerwhich i did not mindi noticed the walls were filthyscratched and beat up and dirty that was my view so of course its all i could focus on the waiter did not show up for 5 min to take our drink order and when he did it took 20 min to get them to us he apologized but at 845 on a saturday night that waiting for a first drink is not fun when then settled down with our menus and picked our choices it was then we were told that they were out of the veal which of course 2 of us had chosen by then and that there was only one skate dishwhich of course the other 2 of us had decided on they were also out of 3 other items i felt i was back in the old eleve located in this same spotthe food was great there as wellwhen they did not run out of many items on the menu they may be ok when you have a larger menu but with a small menu to begin with this is a real disappointment gone were the pop rocks that i thought was so fun as an intermezzo instead a spoon of something that was not described was set down in front of us a simple saladgoodwas 15and most starters are at least that much good but not worth the price otherwise entrees were goodnot special but tasty and served with good presentation the cotton candy is still thereand still an attention getter and i still love the desert selectionsespecially the malt that i had with mini doughnuts in with dipping sauces i think i am able to overlook the fact that its really not an attractive roomthe energy from the kitchen and the close tables add noise and excitement to the room but the art and lighting is ugly and now that its starting to look run down as wellthere are too many new beautiful places in the city with equally good food and equally as pricey that are not in strip mall and they usually still have most menu selections on a saturday night
__label__1 this place is your standard hole in the wall pho theyve got good tasting pho and spring rolls for cheap d the cleanliness is definitely lacking but more flavor fo yo noodlee
__label__0 i actually yelped this restaurant from my brunch table and my blackberry wouldnt post the review so will try to capture the original intensity of the yelp i still love my blackberry and maintain it is better than iphone by the way anyway anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life when i moved to phoenix to work for a catholic hospital my best friend bought me a jesus toast stamp which puts an imprint of the mary which appears better when the bread is toasted i guess she wanted me to fit in so when i told my waiter i was having a bad toast experience and he blew me off you can imagine the impact i ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies nutella honey etc my oatmeal came out with overbuttered grilled bruschettastyle toast thats ita plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread i asked for flatware then brown sugar and milk then inquired about my basket of willow bread the waiter said this is the toast that comes with your meal i reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam i decided to stop complaining cus i had been making ridiculous requests like being served what i ordered and having utensils i put jam on the toast and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease meanwhile the table next to us the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful sunday was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments i told the waiter i wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork still a veggie after 25 years and he said again this is the toast that comes with your meal my friend was getting embarrassed so i gave it up and left how hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread ok now all the anger is stirred up i must say that my florist is one of my fav weeknight spots and their pianist is first rateamazing she truly plays from her soul and her personality shines through in her interpretations of classic songs i have been there since the toast experience but make my friend arrive first to look for the waiter with the ponytail
__label__1 i had lunch here the other day it was a bit before the noon lunch rush so it wasnt too crowded you could tell they were gearing up for it so i can tell they get pretty busy so come early to avoid waiting with throngs of school kids that undoubtedly come from the high school next door i like that their menu isnt huge with zillions of burger combos and other options it was pretty straight forward i had the standard burger fries and a drink everything looks like it is pretty much cooked to order so it took a few minutes to get my food which was ok the cashier guy who looked suspiciously like ray liotta was very friendly and working like crazy so im pretty sure he was the manager if not the owner the burger was thick juicy and cooked perfectly it was a tad bit greasy but that made it that much more delicious the fries were also pretty good they are crinkle cut with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside and fluffiness on the inside i wasnt exactly sure what to do with the little cup of sauce they give you so i used it for my fries and my burger i think it was some chipotle mayo stuff it was pretty good but an odd thing to put on burgers andor fries this place isnt exactly cheap but it is worth it i cant think of a better fast food burgerfries in the area i would return to get the burger but i really want to try their italian beef as well
__label__1 since i was in az area for the weekend with my gf for pleasure we decided to visit one of my friends in the area she picked this place and we decided to get seafood instead of steak or a meat house first of all id suggest making reservations otherwise do not come here we showed up at 7pm but werent seated until 845 good thing we ate a really good lunch otherwise id be starving and complaining like a baby at least this gave us time to have a few drinks before dinner in the large outdoor waiting patio area i think it was so crowded because it was the weekend before fat tuesday this place kinda reminds me of bubba gump or something similar it seems fun and they do have a large bar and waiting area we ordered alligator and frog legs as an appetizer loved it we wanted the fried alligator and frog legs but the waiter absolutely loved that he worked here and highly recommended that we order it grilled instead since he worked here we figured why not i was thinking to myself that the cooks were a bit lazy and maybe they didnt want to prepare it lol to my surprise it was good as he mentioned i have had both before but not for a few years so i was pleased my gf ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was really good i ordered a combination seafood plate which was good but not great there are way too many things to order on the menu a lot of fried food so if you are trying to watch your dietweight then dont come here i would definitely come here again but i wouldnt be in any rush great for a lot of people and groups but please make reservations
__label__1 this place isnt bad the place is pretty big in size and i love that they have a drivethru i like coming here on the weekends especially when i need to study particularly in the vault some times they have live music which can be good or bad depending on if youre there to study or hang out they have decent coffee not the best but not awful and id prefer to go here over starbucks any day
__label__0 so i have been to the location in tucson and now experienced this one and i have to say that i did not have a wow or yummm drooling moment at either dont get me wrong its not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and i will pass next time there is just better mexican cuisine out there service was promt though
__label__1 this place is what desert ridge wishes it was its great for groceries walmart bargain hunting tj maxx fast food or dining in tons of places catching a movie harkins stocking up the wine shelf bevmo new panties vickys secret and a zillion other things i love that this is close to my house the only thing that would make it better is a costco or sams club
__label__1 delicious with me im all about frosting and sprinkles delivers big thick layer of frosting on every cupcake i recently had the mocha dark choc cupcake with mocha frosting wow it was so rich i had to take a break of about 5 min before i could finish it im a big fan of the vanilla and banana you just cant go wrong with cream cheese frosting right oh and the best thing of all you can get a shot of frosting yep a 1oz dixie cup piled high with a flavor of your choice for 75cents i usually eat my frosting shot in the store while waiting for my cupcake order its pricey but its not an everyday thing its a treat and a good one
__label__1 wow the food and atmosphere here are great the music was a little too loud but for a weekend away this place hit the spot perfectly the wait was rather lengthy so we stalked the bar until some folks left then had our dinner there i had the largest shrimp cocktail of my life some really good wine and grilled asparagus there are so many delicious options in scottsdale but this is pretty specific in vibe check it out
__label__1 i go to pros ranch market often for lunch sometimes several times a week ive had the street tacos chile relleno burritos and some other tasty treats im a huge fan of the agua fresca stand my favorites are the strawberry pineapple and horchata and the bakery oh the bakery they have everything sweet you could want including individual servings of flan and tres leches cake the store itself has the cheapest produce in town a giant meat counter and a great assortment of cheeses ranch market also has super delicious tortilla chips and salsas this is one of my favorite places to go if im on my way to a bbq or party there are so many options
__label__1 we made a last minute decision to go out on new years eve the restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar our favorite place to sit and the bar tenders blake kennan and clair were on it they were very busy but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill the food was excellent my husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and i had prime rib with lobster tail and twice baked potato everything was cooked to perfection oh yes start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy
__label__1 friendly staff and great americanos
__label__1 a small bite goes a long way i first was introduced to these brownies in 09 when i received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for christmas i love the packaging the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper after devouring my first brownie i was an instant fan the card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week the can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months i used it for baking cookies breads cakes etc my faves cream cheese espresso nib toffee crunch and caramel the sprites are just the perfect size because its just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming i just throw one in my purse before i leave the house and i can have it with my coffee in the afternoon im a subscriber of their email so ive been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping its so hard to resist lucky me i stumbled on a groupon several months ago and i got a box of 24 sprite for almost half the price plus shipping
__label__1 my first box of ngd arrived a few weeks and tears nearly came to my eyes as i removed the produce from the box i havent seen such beautiful fresh well packaged produce since i was a kid and im no spring chicken the carrots tasted like the sweet carrots i remember and the lettuce with the dirt from the farm still fresh on the leaves so full of flavor the amazing thing is that i had come to expect most organic vegetables and fruits to be less visually appealing than the chemical type but such is not the case with ngd the medium size box has been perfect for our little family of four it is delivered on our day like clockwork around 2am the unseen elf that drops off the goodies is nice enough to open the carton and place all the contents in our cooler so everything stays nice in this boiling cauldron we call phoenix furthermore i live way out in carefreecave creek where we always expect to be on the list of places too far away for delivery not with ngd it appears from the labeling they have optimized their routes so they can include many outlying areas finally there is a gentleman named ben that works for ngd he has been very helpful in making sure everything is going smoothly and that we are using the service properly we think ngd is a great value for organic produce delivered to your door and highly recommend ngd
__label__1 my boyfriend and i were searching for a dive near our house in old town for when we just arent feeling the typical scottsdale vibe i gotta tell you i think we found it we walked in around 7 on a thursday night just looking to have a few drinks and some time to talk i immediately realized this was not an old town bar i think i might have been the youngest person there and no one was pretentious at all they have a dart board and pool table and seating with walled mirrors all around the patio was extremely wellmisted which was great since it was the day before 4th of july and everyone was pretty much sweltering drinks were stiff and not too expensive and the crowd grew younger as the night went on i didnt meet tons of people but the ones ii did either seemed drunk super nice or both not a bad combination i would go back again just not every night what do you think i am an alcoholic also for those of you with bladders of steel and small wallets i saw a sign that says they do bladder buster deals on tuesday night small cover and incredibly cheap drinks until someone breaks the seal i would suck at this but im sure many a person has taken advantage of this interesting drink special
__label__1 this is a nothing but pies placeso i was expecting a little bit more oomph dispointing small selection of pie by the slicesalso you gotta put in special order ahead of time for the more interesting stuff like italian ricotta i was going to order something with berries but the stuff i saw in the case was just runny and wet lookingso i ended up with a blackbottom piei really liked the flaky crust and the filling wasnt bad except for the fact that it did taste a bit over refrigerated a minor gripe is the airpot coffeenot freshly breweddespite the espresso machine clearly visibile behind the counter the pies are just over 4 per slice and 20 per pie
__label__1 good choice of ingredients a bit out of a student budget but it was worthy all the way i was drooling with the flavors good environment and good service and good music bistro style im not much of a pizza eater but this has a good place in my list forget about your papa dough or cheap sunday pizzasthis is a real one
__label__1 japanese chefs top notch sashimi affordable neighborhood sushi place 55 id lived in japan before and this place can beat those in tokyo if you go to hiro you have to order their sashimi we always order scallops sashimi yellow tail salmon toro sashimi and uni sea urchin their rolls are amazing too all sashimi comes in a bigfatlap portion very fresh the service is great too
__label__1 i love the army but they make me wake up wicked early then i work work work and when lunch rolls around me want tasty goodness fast mamma mias is the solution i got their 2 slice deal mushrooms this cost me 4that alone makes it rockstar but you have to ask yourselfdoes it get any better oh yes it does the crust was crunchy the cheese ooeygooey and the mushrooms plentiful which made me disgustingly happy i think pizza places never put enuf mushroomstoday i met my match the joint is hoppin but they still manage to get you out in about 10 minutes plus you get to stare at frank sinatra while you wait young cute blue eyes not the older less attractive version and listen to the tv blaring and if you are me the queen of movie trivia you enjoy your wait as a time to school coworkers in the game while you wait for your awesome slices moral of the story go young ones and enjoy the food is plentiful and cheap atmosphere friendly but small its easy to misskeep your eyes peeled
__label__0 i went here for a business conference granted i just came back from a really nice place in nyc but i still expected something amazing since it was called the grand resort i must agree with fellow yelpers that it seemed a bit outdated i did not like the rooms there was a baby sink and mirror area a bazaar bar in the living room that just didnt seem to fit the beds were mediocre i did enjoy the kid free pool i found it very hard to find my way around this damn place i got lost several times i did appreciate their concierge service very helpful i needed a sewing kit to fix a button that came off 7 later i had one small thing of thread baby scissors and a needle drinks and food were sky high we ended up walking down to a little mexican food restaurant nearby i dont think i would go back
__label__1 okay i admit it we are waaaaay late to this party we tried once before but the hourplus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day this time our strategy was to go early on a saturday morning as close to 630am opening as possible we arrived around 715 it was the weekend after all and only waited about 20min for a table for two i had the special of the day 3egg scramble with andouille sausage fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese yum the sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked my companion had the hog and chick awesome meaty bacon with that great value for the price i packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home who could not be roused at dawn if you havent been get up early bring a newspaper and rest assured matts big is well worth the wait
__label__1 im very excited about their authentic and inexpensive menu we just had appetizers today but cant wait to come back for dinner the mofongo and alcapurrias were beautiful
__label__1 this place just opened up next to the salon i work in amazing they hit the ground running its a deli style where you order at the counter and they bring you the food i had the grayhawk turkey club and the turkey was great no packaged crap here it was thick sliced and probably rotisserie for the side i had sweet potato tater tots delish the have regular fries sweet fries tater tots onion rings etc great looking salads chicagostyle dogs gourmet burgers and yummy sounding mac and cheese the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the price its great for dinner but a little steep for a work day lunch
__label__1 all i needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good cuban cigar and some brandy we had the papa rellena for an appetizer very very good its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce for entrees my wife and i shared two dishes the ropa viejas shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce and the gallina frita crispy fried shredded chicken onions in a mojo garlic lime sauceamazing both dishes were largewith tons of meat great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the havana cafe for dessert we indulged on the best of phoenix phoenix new times caramel flan omg and the coffee was yummy too we also found a 15 coupon in dineinazcom saved us almost 7 as the sign over the door says cha cha cha
__label__1 this was the first place my husband to me out to eat out when we started dating omg i loved it the staff is always extremely nice prompt at this location we enjoy their food and i epically am in love with the 99 cent margaritas they are the best we always have a wonderful time here new and old memories
__label__1 the flower studio far exceeded my expectations at my wedding christine is an amazing artist businesswoman and person she made time to meet with me outside her regular hours and really understood my vision for my wedding her arrangements for my wedding were absolutely stunning and really took the event to the next level i am more than thrilled with this company and would recommend them to anyone thank you flower studio for making my wedding so beautiful
__label__1 the food is good but i think the prices are too high for what you get considering there are plenty of other places to go for good subs salads and fruit platters that would be much cheaper its hard to choose duck and decanter over them however i will go here when i dont have to pay why not right
__label__1 i like the thai hut because it is safe thai eating they have some of the more adventurous authentic thai and then they have what i always get the garden delight with beef just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade they always have plenty of servers on hand and ive never been disappointed theres just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing i struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4 but i settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks they are really close to the light rail now though just get off at mcdowellcentral and walk one block east on mcdowell
__label__1 not that you can compare firebird to anywhere else in az but i have been to joliet raceway in chicago and even though thats newer i like the arrangement of firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on first off nhra come on hands down one of the coolest events in az ever next to nascar and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year the pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars beer and food are expensive but what else is new they also have drag racing events any type of racing event drift road moto races dirt bikes monster trucks top fuel drag boats on the lake im sure im missing a lot but nowhere else has this in az parking is always good to go driving out of there just takes a while as youve got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the i10 but not much they can do about that great place keep bringing in the nhra and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and ill be happy
__label__1 it isnt often enough that i get to dine at carlsbad but last night i decided to have dinner there ill be completely honest service is always a mixed bag but then you figure when theyre crammed to the gills which is generally how it goes you cant always expect speedy freaking gonzales to be your server however last night i dont think i could have sneezed between the time i ordered my food and when it arrived to my table excellent is all i can say about this joint if youre looking for some tasty new mexican fare get over there and if its packed let the valet park your carcuz its free start off with a dos equis amber get some nachosthis vegetarian will eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz its just that tasty and kick back preferably on the patiobecause theres a waterfall and if jacobs working the bar expect nothing but the best in cocktails seriously
__label__1 truly a neighborhood bar didnt know anyone here and didnt leave without catching everyones name maybe not as wide of a beverage selection as the pizzeriaturnedbar in the same lot but definitely lots more fun will return
__label__1 this is now amore sports grill try the sausage peppers they are to die for
__label__1 this is my kind of place had i not known of the lost leaf i would have never found it its a house in the historic district after hesitantly walking in i find it to be a cozy dimly lit house it reminded me of hanging out at a friends place in college well replace the blacklight posters with art work the beer selection is top notch as well as the music i dont go out to bars much seeing as i am on a drinking hiatus but this is a place i would go to just for the atmosphere music and folks
__label__1 i will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30 mins every time i go that can only mean its good right well its that friendly and that good that i dont mind waiting i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it im not fond of their potato has thingys but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty my favorite item turkey sausage eggs benedict dd style trade sausage gravy for hollandaise very filling as you can imagine breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch this is my spot
__label__0 their amazing prices are instantly countered by despairing customer service if i want low prices i will go to goodwill over this place looks like dillards is on my list of do not shop
__label__1 im pretty much in agreement with the previous five reviews a great way to spend the day when its hitting over a hundred degrees its about a fortyfive minute drive from phoenix i went on a saturday afternoon around three or so so i missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch along with the sun at its hottest point its about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four rentals are 14pp which includes your tube rental and shuttle service this is the all day rate so if you get there in the morning you can go back again and again its 10pp without the tube rental you can also rent a tube for your ice chest styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away which is a must as you need to load up on tons of water and your beverage of choice bring along tons of sunblock and reapply often bring a hat though because youll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you a few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube so think about bringing those along too and bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because its definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current dont be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka spies to show off because youll look like an idiot when you lose it and yes the river is dirty with river grass pee marshmallows every other kind of food possible etc but you hope with the quick current flowing that it makes the water less dirtyyou hope at least and please take your trash with you the shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free so please take a couple with you on the river they require that children be a minimum of 8 years old and four feet tall before theyll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river it can be a fast river but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river its open 9 am to 7 pm seven days a week the last tube rental is at 4 pm and lost tubes will cost you 20 each you need a drivers license for every four or five tube rentals and no glass containers your ice coolers will be inspected before youre allowed to board were on the lookout for more rivers to float on
__label__1 food was good i had the choppino fruittas de mare apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me but the serving was typical for a fruits de mare type plate that ive had at other restaurants sauce was nice spicy and good flavor pasta was cooked well and the right portion size i think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger other than the imitation crab a disappointment but not a deal breaker the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari mussels etc kids spaghetti was very good i taste all the kids spaghetti since i have 3 kids and invariably someone doesnt finish or even start their bowl the pasta was cooked well the meatball was decent but the sauce was shick and chunky not watery which i hate and covered all the pasta which for some reason other restaurants cant seem to do there isnt a specific kids menu but the server said they make kids portion size of anything on the menu but the price isnt available to be seen so you have to trust they arent going to bend you over on those which they didnt bread of course was available prior to meals the butter used is very tasty some type of garlic i think bread was warm soft and not overcooked now i would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions the decor and slower service decor was dreadful sorry old and dated i think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs pictures and everything inside screams 1970s the chairs remind me of an old conference hall the lighting is on the dark side i guess if i was out on a date or with 4 retired couples it would be a nicer decor but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesnt fit quite right kid friendly not quite but kid accomidating is more like it since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them overall the food is good servers friendly but not the family friendly place i usually prefer
__label__0 my office moved to the area so i was driving around and saw the sign best sandwich um no if you want i can come in there and show you how to cook a chicken cheese steak first dont wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy second put some meat on there it was 50 bun it should be toasted and crunchy and price a 12 chicken cheese chips and drink was 13are you kidding me for that price i was hoping for the best i ever had change it up capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market
__label__1 been a few times at various times for various reasons food 45 love the bruschetta sandwiches are good really no complaints good alcohol selection service 45 i always receive good service valet is always youthful atmosphere 35 casual great place for meeting friends can be a little too busy for my liking price 35 average i cant really complain overall i dont go out of my way to go here but i certainly recommend it
__label__0 wont be going there again our chicken was pink manager was a prick in regards to that and service was all around crappy
__label__0 i dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on tatum my husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive the margaritas come from a stolen recipe from la pinata nueva but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them i hope they get it that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back
__label__1 had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted i had the build your own omelete i got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese it was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price they had fresh squeezed orange juice too not the best breakfast ive had but it was good
__label__0 i will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude i will not go back we came in and were given a table menus were practically thrown at us and then we waited and waited and waited we asked a woman working there and she apparently did not speak english and indicated a man at the front would help us but he was too busy talking we got up and left no one even said a word when we left
__label__0 an interesting concept that didnt end up being what i hoped for i was pretty excited to try the posh noodles noshes japanese street food as prepared by josh hebert i love japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in phoenix unfortunately i was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food the location inside the lexington hotel has definitely seen better days an attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables however it came across as worn and dingy our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings i didnt work here last night but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day we tried a large assortment an expensive mistake duck gyoza w ponzu i prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here also these had the tiniest greasy portion of filling i have ever seen homemade tofu w ginger scallion cherry blossom this was good with a sweet dessertlike flavor but a somewhat runny texture okonomiyaki this japanese pizza was among the better items however the texture of the ingredients was strange ie full slices of bacon rather than smaller bitesized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat tako yaki again a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by breading that fell apart easily the ramen dishes miso ramen w pork goma ramen w pork and shitake mushroom rames were small and more or less indistinguishable from one another we left most of them behind deciding not to take anything with us the dessert green tea pot de crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the 100 meal
__label__1 lately i have been addicted to a good caprese style sandwich and pane biancos is awesome i read the previous reviews so i went there expecting a crowd and nowhere to sit this did not detract from the experience for me because the quality and freshness of the food was more than enough to get and keep my attention the staff were very friendly and helpful being from the atlantic northeast i have high expectations when it comes to italian done well with personality to boot i did not want to wait till i got home to eat my so good smelling prize so i went outside to find picnic style tables and benches it was way to hot to sit outside and i was craving iced coffee so i went next door to lux and was both surprised and relieved to find many of their patrons with pane bianco bags openly eating their lunches with drinks from lux to claim patronage cant wait for a hopefully airconditioned expansion
__label__1 this place might have one of the best beer selections at a reasonable price in all of tempe possibly in the east valley their food is great too service is decent and the daily specials they offer are just plain awesome
__label__1 i been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites i attended a game against the atlanta braves and it was a great experience food prices are typical for any mlb stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper the bigger the beer the cheaper it seems there really isnt a bad seat inside the entire place get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit the staff is very friendly and talkative if i lived in arizona i would get season tickets the merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums 23 for a hat compared to 41 at dodgers stadium
__label__1 one of the most memorable breweries ive been to not because of their personal beer choices but because of how they run the place they have over 30 beers on tap from all over the country if thats not cool enough the entire back wall of the place is refrigerated coolers full of bottles and cans of even more craft brews that you can hand pick to drink in houseorbuild your own 6 pack to carry out brews from all over from epic to dogfish to maui brewing to sierra nevada and the list goes onand onand on it really is a nice concept ohand their food is great too mostly your normal bar food but pretty tasty as for the service i was incredibly impressed at how the girls that were serving us really truly seemed to have some serious beer knowledge they were able to help us pick the right beer for our liking and they were right there when the brews disappeared regardless of the fact the place was packed know before you go dont let the exterior fool you its a small portion of a strip malllook hard or you may miss it
__label__0 yes ive had better the chai lattes are pretty good but not worth 450 for a largewhich was a grande cup size at starbucks prices are just the same as starbucks if not more and they have a credit card surcharge for less than 5 spent i still dont agree with that at any place i go too i liked the local artwork displayed but not impressed if the prices were lower then i could see coming here more often
__label__1 i waited months before finally getting around to coming here and it wasnt all i had hoped for went for my birthday and got the garlic bread appetizer wasnt very good and got crumbs all over the table it had an odd burnt taste got the mushroom and steak calzone which was huge and filling but very greasy and took a long time to actually get to the table they claimed it was the hoagie that one of my friends had that took so long but it shouldnt take so long to cook a sandwich either way delicious but nothing too special for the price i wont likely return here since some of my friends dont like this place
__label__1 great service by the owner nick hes very accommodating and aims to please friendly and helpful i hadnt had an indian fry bread in over 10 years there were several meat choices to choose from and several vegetables to add on top unfortunately an earlier catering order cleaned them out of refried beans and bell peppers the salsa was good spicy but not hot the owner kept the place open for me to enjoy my meal while we chatted he even stayed open later to feed another customer that walked in after the place had been closed for 10 mins he even gave me a coupon for my next visit a truly caring owner nice place in a strip mall with plenty of parking
__label__1 the folks at national car rental were very accommodating and even helped me upgrade my rental at little cost to me if the deal was right i would definitely use this company again when visiting phoenix
__label__1 i am in town visiting and stopped at shea for lunch i actually had a breakfast sandwichbagel even though it was 1pm they said you can have breakfast anytime the service was great and it was very cute inside there are tables and they have free wifi so it would be a great place to meet clients for a casual meeting they also have a drivethru if you want to grab a quick cup of coffee
__label__1 so we finally decided to give cibo another chance and im so glad we did i love love love their patio its very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees the heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and its much quieter than their indoor space this place is a great date spot we both had the prosciutto cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata but unfortunately theyd been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead our waiter also recommended the valpolicella ripasso which was ok but it was a little light for our tastes the pizza was really good the fresh ingredients really come through but we werent the biggest fans of the crust i like something more substantial and airy but for a thin crust pizza it wasnt soggy at all a big plus the bruschetta was also ok dont get me wrong i still ate all of it and would order it again but each bite just needs a little more of a punch service was great and we met karen the owner before we left and she is a doll we had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back
__label__1 i think zipps is alright i fully remember this being the only decent restaurant near where i lived in north scottsdale so it was this or nothing food here is good though they messed up my order and put sour cream on itew but thats a common error whatever im not really a fan of sports and it was loud in here which is to be expected so thats not particularly my taste however i found it to be staffed with friendly people which brings it from 2 to 3 stars in my book
__label__1 what whattt hip hop videos blaring as i get my strike on bowling specials after 9pm friendly staff cheap drink specials from the bar in plastic cups asu and working class stiffs coexisting one sweaty bowling shoe at a time teenagers making out at the arcarde section loooveeee you brunswick
__label__1 first time eating chicken and waffles and it was the best time ever
__label__1 this qt is one of my favorite locations it is always very clean and the staff is upbeat
__label__1 oh true food i want to love you but you make me feel like im eating in a cafeteria with such a contemporary menu and a staff full of bright shiny faces this restaurant is just a contradiction in form the menu and ambience just dont match my advice is to sit at the bar the drinks are well served by pleasant bartenders and do their job the stools are comfortable and from that locale you get to skip the experience of having dinner with a room full of strangers right at your elbow
__label__1 i have to say they are better than subway thats for sure at least they put meat and cheese and the fixings on your sub not like subway where they measure everything and you get home and you pretty much just taste the bread the staff is young but very polite and helpful maybe a little suggestionif you can make homemade salads like macaroni potato salad it would be alot better
__label__1 great soup at a great price i go for the veggie soup normally since im a bit leery of the raw meats and strange meatballs you can get their vermicelli is also quite edible service could be a little quicker bring cash if youre spending less than 5 with pho and water you will pay 350 tax cheapest lunch in town
__label__1 clean fast fairly cheap i had the orange chicken and it was good liked the brown rice option i enjoyed this 619 meal much more than the lame sandwichsoup i had at great grains yesterday and that cost me 1225 ill be back to totts
__label__1 great service by angela and their doc first time i dont have to wear reading glasses as they switched me to a mono contact very enjoyable experience and very quick had a issue with a contact and they track a replacement done right away definitely recommend
__label__0 heres the 1 2 3 1 great food i love hot new mexico style food good job 2 they have a little brewery and make 3 house beers unfortunately theyre all shitty 3 they could really improve the service no bueno well be back for the food it might be take out next time though 41711 update some asshole who was clearly affiliated with arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review i hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site more importantly i hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant good food folks just get it to go to bryan l and the rest of the gang over at arribasgo eff yourselves you get one star and no more of my money learn how to work kid
__label__1 one of my fave restaurants the unlimited salad is a winner its delicious they also have a glutenfree selection that my brother loves for christmas they also have some gift card deals
__label__1 chain restaurant thats just about okay for afternoon dining with friends if i wasnt having beer at lunch id probably suggest eating someplace else food is good but in my experience their beer makes the meal ive eaten here about half a dozen times during the past few years when in town for business weekends it is centrally located on the corner of mill and fifth street in downtown tempe amongst quite a few other local restaurants during my most recent visit i ordered a steak at lunch along with one of the seasonal brewed beers steak was okay but i wouldnt order it again beer was exceptional so i wasnt unhappy overall i love burgers and i think ill stick to that as my primary choice when eating here in the future i cant think of any times when service was particularly unsatisfactory nor were there times when service really stood out as exceptional i have almost always eaten here on a saturday afternoon and its typically been fairly busy during the lunch hour never had a problem getting a table which is important since im usually heading back for an afternoon conference session i love the big glass beer mugs not sure what size they are but i cant always down the whole thing during a short lunch break im a lightweight overall good place to eat if youre hungry and in the downtown area but i wouldnt go out of my way to get here
__label__1 i cannot get enough of lgo my favorite time to come is very early in the morning to enjoy the sun coming up over camelback mountain while having some organic coffee and a blackberry bran muffin the breakfast at lgo has something for everybody imo try the croque mdame if you want something really bold the lunch and dinner options are great too this is the only restaurant i have ever been that i could eat all three meals and feel like i was being served from a different kitchen each time the only draw back i can think of for lgo is the tendency for it to become very crowded thats the best problem a restaurant can have so theyre probably not too worried about it the parking situation can become an issue too but for my time and money its worth it lgo is top notch in my book and you can find me there pretty regularly
__label__1 ive brought my dogs here and met with both dr holmes and dr edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful over the last 15 years of living in phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and i wouldnt go anywhere else this past summer i moved to boston and regrettably havent found a quality veterinary hospital like pecan grove ashamedly even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers we called pecan grove and dr holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone while the answer we got from our boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer pecan grove and everyone there is amazing and i wouldnt go anywhere else had i not moved across the country
__label__1 i didnt realize that this store was very close to my home i used to go to musicians discount on southern and alma school road however i had went there saturday and it was closed so i decided to check out what other stores are around the customer service was good and they were also helpful regarding some questions that i had regarding electric guitars i didnt really compare prices to other places so i cannot honestly respond in price comparison i had noticed that they had a lot of novelty shaped guitars they also seemed to have a large quantity of replacement strings for guitars they also appear to have a large selection of sheet music i recommend checking them out if you are looking for a music instrument store near dobson and baseline road in mesa arizona
__label__1 i know kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence i have not needed her services and most of us dont plan on needing an attorney but i am always reminded by a tagline that kerrie often mentions people in crisis need company droban company how very true when that time comes and in these troubled days it will you will need good company i would look for kerrie to help and so should you
__label__0 get the white chocolate but leave the strawberries and cream flavor too fauxberrychemical tasting
__label__1 my roommate and i went here for drinks before going to see a show in phoenix pleased to see their happy hour menu still counted on saturdays we took advantage of their amazing margaritas i suggest ordering on the rocks with salt gall blanco is at the base of the clarenton hotel in downtown phoenix and is in the most perfect spot for admiring the building from a far we choose to sit outside which wasnt the best idea because the hostes couldnt figure out how to work the fans and the misters were creating small great lakes on the edge tables but we werent uncomfortable
__label__1 dont be confused by the yelp definition yay im a fan lowes gets 4 stars because they have great employees that get me out of there fast im not one that would typically be classified as handy so the fact that i can go into lowes and get someone to give me diy instructions in about 5 minutes makes me happy ive been to several loweshome depots in the past but i feel compelled to review this location because after 10 trips mostly on the weekends i have never had to wait for assistance or behind more than one customer in line also they get bonus points for not only allowing my pups in the building but complementing them on their cuteness
__label__1 i see a lot of four starsperhaps im too generous with my five stars im a giver attended a party for georgie on friday night and had a great time easy to find easy to park easy to get a drink plus hey they have the same turbo nozzle ac vents that i have in my home i could live there exposed brick me too felt right at home i love the way they display their art im assuming from local artists i would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking however no problems there thankfully
__label__0 after several hundred professional massages over the past 20 years i encountered today a first a massage therapist who explained that she could not do a massage involving any but mild pressure using her hands it was an issue of protecting the thumbs when i told her i didnt like forearms and elbows she explained that shed never worked without using her forearms and i assume her elbows too after just five minutes when i asked for more pressure she suggested we stop the massage that she wasnt the therapist for me she was right what are they teaching these people these days and why doesnt an excellent outfit like lifetime fitness insist on better skills among its massage staff i wont offer her name but if considering a massage at this establishment i suggest casie as the only therapist here worth the money
__label__1 i had a lot of fun playing this course today with my 12year old son who hits in the low 100s we also played this course back in november when we were here in town and had an equally enjoyable time the course is in great shape and we were able to finish our round in around 45 hours the staff here are very friendly and accommodating and the beverage cart came by around 5 times during our round the price they gave us as return outoftowners for a sunday morning teetime was incredible 2 adults at 89 each 40 rental free junior fees 15 junior rental other similar quality local courses wanted to charge full fees for juniors for the same tee time so i really appreciated the gesture if they keep this policy in tact this will be my regular course when my son and i come back in town as for the course the early holes are typical resort style holes followed by 5 or so residential public coursestyle holes the beauty of this course is the back9 desertstyle holes that wrap around into the south mountain before returning back into the resort with the final par3 that provides a breath taking semipanoramic view of the valley from downtown phoenix to the superstition mountains i found the back9 to be short but very technical constantly testing my course management abilities ie thought i could hit onto the green from the whites on every par4 but came up short every time would definitely recommend this course for other outoftowners like me who want to get in a quick round on a nice course the pro shop is small but wellstocked the restaurant has patio seating overlooking the first tee and serves some decent food however they need to get better beers on tap ipas and microbrews would be nice
__label__1 always fresh and friendly food is priced just a skosh above the actual value but the place is clean people are nice worth trying yes lunchtime sushi is great teriyaki bowl is good brown rice extrabooo overall worth the very close the the 900 you will spend on lunch at yogis
__label__1 very nice and helpful staff one guys always asks me too many questions but i figured he was just trying to be nice theyre on top of trying to sell you a new phone and service but when you shoot them down they get off your ass about it
__label__1 45 the only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the location the view from the patio is pretty much parking lot and the backs of buildings but holy cow the wine selection is very good the staff are friendly and helpful and make excellent suggestions thanks for the zinfandel tip yummm the prices are fair too and as much as i love green chile my new fave is the fig and gorgonzola app still a pannini i didnt know blue cheese could get that creamy when it melted man i wish this place was closer ill still be back
__label__0 this might be a good way to kill time if youre near the airport the food really wasnt that great it tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time i had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm wayyy too salty and the shrimp were mushy it was pretty gross the carne asada tacos were mostly gristle and i couldnt really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them for 20 i couldve gotten much better mexican food somewhere else
__label__1 i love christmastime and i especially love it because i know that luminarias is back and this year its better than ever the staff and volunteers at the dbg do an excellent job of directing guests through the garden between the welllit paths with luminarias of course helpful staff and amazing acts this is an event not to be missed i consider this to be the ultimate activity for adults its romantic if youre on a date its festive if youre with your family and its just pure fun if youre with friends you enter the park to be immediately greeted by hundreds of meowganificant luminarias lighting up the entire garden cocktail stations lie in every knook and cranny and they serve delicious festive drinks like my favorite hot cocoa and raspberry vodka if youre hungry they sell food throughout the garden at two locations then there are the performers the dbg does an amazing job of bringing in musicians of every shape and size whether its a trio of christmas carolers a mariachi band or a lively jazz band they have bands in every corner lighting up the night i am also continuously impressed with the acoustics of the garden with so many live acts in one area you can barely hear a specific act until you are in that area their event planners did an amazing job luminarias is my favorite arizona activity during the holidays and i cant wait to go back next year
__label__1 i came here with a friend who has been here many times and recommended it i wasnt disappointed first we came during the lunch rush and it was busy however we were still seated immediately and served by a friendly waitress quickly the food then came out in about 5 minutes i had the rib tip plate and it was very good my friend had the pulled pork sandwich which was also good its out off the beaten path but worth the trip when you pull into a place out in a strange location and its packed good sign
__label__1 i love this store for years now i discovered it here the candles are wonderful i love the little travel sampler kit the yuzu bergamot moisturizer is great i enjoy the soaps this is the type of store that you just go for the product and know it is just going to cost more honestly it is not the much for many items the little kits like the cranberry orange body wash 2 oz cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz mint thyme body wash 2 oz mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz bamboo creme body wash 2 oz bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz packaged in a reusable zippered bag all for 25 bucks clove soap 2 oz honey almond soap 2 oz lavender lime soap 2 oz lemongrass soap 2 oz oatmeal lavender soap 2 oz rosemary soap 2 oz rosemary peppermint soap 2 oz rose tangerine lavender soap 2 oz seven seed lemon rosemary soap 2 oz vetivert grapefruit soap 2 oz wild mint soap 2 oz yuzu soap 2 oz for 38 bucks bamboo creme moisturizer 2 oz mint thyme moisturizer 2 oz lavender lime moisturizer 2 oz yuzu bergamot moisturizer 2 oz cranberry orange moisturizer 2 oz sweet almond sea kelp moisturizer 2 oz zippered travel bag for 25 bucks why yes you just read my stocking stuffers for myself that i just sent my husband hehe d worth trying you will find a favorite quality of their ingredients from their website using only pure essential oils vitamins and antioxidants and rare fruits and herbs and never using synthetic fragrances or colors now were also sourcing organic ingredients when possible and are on track to have all of our products be parabenfree and slsalsfree by mid2010 service she was very nice and was even happier when she saw i was a little shop happy when i started putting everything on the counter hehe from st louis and loved it tldr the products are a favorite of mine good products and good service at this location great outdoor mall
__label__1 so i emailed east maryland the same afternoon as my visit explaining that i was disappointed that the coupon i had given them was not honored and they emailed me back before the end of the day apologizing and letting me know that my visa would be credited the amount of the coupon then they called today to see how the boys were all doing after their shots and acknowledged the bill issue again and hoped that everything had been settled to my satisfaction this kind of immediate and friendly followup redeemed them and gained them another star
__label__0 trendy loudmusic oksushi 25 when we lived right across the street from the sushi brokers j and i used to go there at least once a month for its happy hour we probably had been there at least 8 times with friends and family i have to say that the quality was good for the start but went downhill since then the price was right if you go during the happy hour other time kinda expensive with the quality and service it was a seentobeseen place with okquality sushi
__label__1 had breakfast at joes diner this morning i had the number 2 and a side of potatoes it was supposed to come with 2 bacon and 2 sausage but for some reason mine came with four pieces of bacon i didnt question it because the waitress seemed a little absent minded and we had to ask for a side that she had already forgotten the few times she came to check on us she would ask if everything was ok and would walk away so fast that we couldnt tell her what we needed the positive here is that the pancakes were really tasty i would have given joes 4 stars if the service was better but i think there could be some improvement there
__label__1 could have been 4 stars i went here for the first time last friday it was busy but they dont have that many tables and there were at least 4 waitresses on that i could see our services was sooooooo slllllllow like painfully slow we waited a long time for refills a long time for our food a long time for the check to come it was really annoying our waitress was nice but slow onto the food we got an order of wings and an order of the fried zucchini the zucchini was really good but holy hell she should have warned us that it had just came out of the fryer that may have been heated by lava i popped one of those bad boys in my mouth and immediately felt the skin on the roof of my mouth start to come off once the burning subsided i was good to go i hear the wings were tasty they were really big i just dont eat wings i ordered the fish and chips so yummy our friend got the grilled chicken sandwich with a side of grilled asparagus love that they offer grilled veggies as a side i snuck a couple asparagus and they were tasty hubs got the ribs it was a huge pile of meat on a plate he loved it i will for sure go back the food was really great i will just know not to expect quick service
__label__1 the fooddelicious the atmosphererelaxing the servicepretty spoton the pricingehhh not my thing here the only way i was able to eat here was because a family friend treated my family out but if youre looking to spoil yourself or anyone you know with food this is the place to do it i ordered the chicken romano panseared with a blend of romano cheese panko breadcrumbs with lemon shallot butter tomatoes asparagus yukon gold mashed potatoes the chicken panseared with bread crumbs was great to eat crispy on the outside and juicy on the insidethe asparagus ive had better but the yukon gold mashed potatoes were silky buttery and made perfectly they went well with the chicken romano my dad ordered the ny strip and they were kind of enough to cut it up for him since he was handicapped they checked up on us frequently the only thing i would complain about was they actually came up and asked if i was done already grabbing at my plate when the fork was still in my mouth because apparently i was still eating since that ruined my entire experience thus far i just told them to take it in addition the entire table got an order of the unlimited salad bar the salad bar was great but nothing like the choices offered at souplantation also because i ate the salad beforehand i wasnt able to finish off the main entree i ordered will i be back probably not
__label__1 fun atmosphere great hhour prices we took my 89 year old padre there and he had a ball looking at all of the stuffed animals had the fried shrimp curds what are curds really and the burgerbrats and beer for only 6 asked for med rare on the burger but it came out medium no pink i will try rare next time 3 blind moose house wine for 3 bucks 37pm everyday life is good in scottsdale stay thirsty my friends
__label__1 the new harkins cine capri one of the first things to open in tempe marketplace boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks moviegoers can order brownie bites mozzarella sticks and pizza the theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy and the screen is huge this is my new favorite movie theatre

__label__1 this was our first time at texas bbq house they gave us a sample and help us with our order the brisket was fantastic i got the moist and my wife got the lean we both enjoyed our choices immensely i will definitely go back i wanted some spicy bbq sauce and apparently they have it but i didnt see it
__label__0 ive been to multiple buca di beppo locations in several cities they are a good place to go with a large group we went to this location with a group of nine the menu was typical we ordered the seafood trio which was nice and the fried mozzarella which was also good the caesars salad was also good we ordered pasta entrees and chicken all of which were served up warm and in plentiful portions we left with a fair amount of food i would give the food four stars however i would give the service one star two in our party ordered cocktails five of us ordered wine with dinner all drinks arrived together with our entrees we did not get enough dinner plates we did not get enough wine glasses and had to wait for three more three entrees arrived together and we had to wait about five minutes for the fourth to arrive we had to ask three times for boxes to put our leftovers in we were never asked if we wanted dessert if the service were spot on the rating would be much higher but i cant justify it
__label__1 the obsession started about 2 yrs ago and i havent looked back since started with getting them catered for lunch then a trip here or there to the restaurant so good the bread is amazing but the love sweat tears and what ever else they pop in there is addicting hmmm now i am wondering what it is they put in there anyway i wont think too long and hard about that one but tomorrow im definitely heading back for the vermonter gotta feed the addiction
__label__0 very bad service below average sushi 2 stars the 2 stars is because the quality of food is below average and not that great the salmon looks like its been on the plates forever and has a real slimy look ive had way better sushi in some all you can eat places basically the only good thing is the gimmick with the conveyor belt i would advise the reader to save hisher money for a better sushi place like kabuki the next bad thing about this place is the atrocious service they never bring you the drinks or seat you in a timely manner god knows what the waitresses do over therethey run around as if its their first day at work and never get anything done like clear tables get checks etc ive been here a couple of times and i saw that the 2nd time the patrons were not even waiting for the waitressesthey formed a line at the cashier like dennys
__label__1 after long debate of where to have lunch i am glad that i stopped into the greek pita i had ordered the lamb gyro with everything except onions the gyro was loaded with lamb meat and toppings the pita was soft and fresh the tzatziki sauce has a nice tang to it it tasted light cool and creamy the total cost was 574 tax i left with a very happy belly
__label__1 loved the winkie eat your vegan meal next door at green and stroll over to nami for dessert
__label__1 i have been exploring more of the park recently i want to add that the national trail which is almost 15 miles long and goes from one end to the other is a real gem the views on this trail are outstanding and on the western half you will find far fewer people than on the eastern half highly recommended
__label__1 i took a cooking class with chef eddie matney eddies house restaurant and his recipe called for vanilla bean olive oil from the olive mill first off what he made with this recipe was phenomenal much thanks to that smooth vanilla olive oil in there i decided to google this place only to find out that chef beau macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his bad boy favorite i dont know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since ive had his food and was quite impressed i decided to make the 45 minute drive from scottsdale out there on a sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich such a cool atmosphere inside its like a trader joesgift shopparadise bakery all with a rural kinda on the farm feel you could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale i couldnt believe the kalamata sandwich if you go there and order anything elseyoure wrong freshest ingregients ive ever tasted i feel like the pork could have just been butchered 5 minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden which they do have there pretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well make for some unstoppable pancakes tried the gellato and wasnt all that impressed but in all due fairness im not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all ive had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon definitely worth the drive great place to bring the family
__label__1 i met some friends last night at cadillac ranch and this was my first time going the space has a very odd layout but there are two bars one inside and one outside on the patio and both have plenty of tvs to watch there is also a very cliche mechanical bull but unfortunately or maybe fortunately no one rode it while i was there service at the bar was really good but when our group moved to a table service became spotty we had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missedthe two servers just didnt coordinate very well luckily we werent in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group i only ate the cadillac salad mixed greens tomatoes cheese and croutons and it was a nice size for 795 however and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine but i hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you i prefer for it to come on the side as it does in almost every single restaurant i have ever been to so i can put on as much as i would like i did try a few of my friends fries and they were goodnot oily and for fries they were actually pretty light as a note for groups they put an automatic 20 gratuity on the bill not the standard 18 most other places do overall i wouldnt recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as i was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were however the three stars i am giving cadillac ranch are for their happy hour 2 domestics 3 imports 3 fat tire bottles 3 flavored smirnoff vodka drinks 3 margaritas 4 rum captain morgan 5 vodka martinis 350 to 5ish select appetizers there are about four or five im always happy when i can get stella drafts for cheap also according to the bartender one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong one piece of advice if you start at the bar and move to a table close your tab at the bar even if they offer to transfer it to your table we had a huge mess last night and some people overpaid and some of us underpaid
__label__1 these girls know how to make working out awesome and fun quality instructors will not disappoint lots of variety
__label__1 evas seems to be the place we go to every time we visit family in casa grande now it is a pretty consistent experience and thats good enough for us when were out of town the food is pretty good their sauces are on the spicy side but thats ok with us theyre still packed with flavor and they compliment the meals the carne asada burrito enchilada style is a large portion again the sauce elevates it to being a little bit better than average tasting the cheese enchiladas with their white jalapeño sauce were a little bit small but very good the rice that the combinations get served with is just soso their chips are fine the salsa is a little bit weak the food quality is average overall the service has never been that good theyre not particularly attentive or personable i felt like we were a little bit of a hassle at times the last waiter we had advised us to go with a combo plate because it would be cheaper when it turns out if you do the math yourself it was about 3 more expensive the managers solution was to take 1 off the bill and then comp our sodas hmm ok a warning then to you all out there that are watching your cost add your a la carte items up yourself and dont get pressured into the combo especially if you dont want rice andor beans anyway the menu is also slightly confusing the prices are average the decor is nice the restaurant looks like it can serve large groups and parties very well overall evas seems to be a safe place to enjoy a meal and well go there next time we head up that way
__label__1 bar restaurant in that order danielle ammaccapane was an lpga player graduated from thunderbird hs just a few miles awayas did her lpgaplayer sister dina i went to ths and graduated same year as danielle 1983 just sayin i love this place its a great cheers style bar as much as one loathes hearing that type of characterization italian food here is solid and the cocktails have a punch nice place to watch football at the bar when by oneself too
__label__1 i read the reviews on charlestons and decided to take the plunge even though there were a few negative reviews i am a visitor to az for business and have grown so tired of restaurant food i love salad and find most places dont know how to make a decent salad the one at charlestons was so good with fresh tomato and egg and the creamy garlic dressing yummy the filet was medium well and i not being a steak fan usually need some type of sauce except for ruthchris but this steak was really good i took my meal to go and couldnt wait to get the hotel because it smelled so good last but not least was the baked potato the salt on the outside i quote someone else genius i used curbside to go awesome if you havent tried this place go despite the few bad reviews i am now a fan and will do something i rarely do eat the same meal two days in a row i am not kidding it was good
__label__0 sadly i have to join the crowd on this one i was hoping that kitchen 56 would make my memories of vatra go away but instead just reminded me all over again food was way overpriced and just ok kudos to eddie the server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried k56 id give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service personality i will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation but the spots lights at the counterheight 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last calland i dont drink
__label__1 went here for the first time last week and had a great experience the restaurant was very clean the service was great the best part the food ive been in az for 10 years now and i can say without a doubt that its some of the best food ive had in a restaurant and this from a pregnant woman no less i had the fried chicken tenders cheesy grits and fried okra first the food came out piping hot i mean steaming and hot to the touch the batter on the chicken was thick and crispy the grits were cooked to perfection dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist and the okra was fantastic too it didnt hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar either i will be back a lot
__label__0 ive decided to completely write this place off and here is why you should too three times i have tried to go here and they have been closed all the while their website and posted hours say they should be open if one of you wants to drive all the way here from the suburbs youd better call first because this place cannot be trusted ive wasted my time and spent hungry minutes walking here only to be disappointed vitamin t will fail there i said it
__label__1 so i was like a lemming trying this after man vs food when recently visiting phoenix but the kid is right everything on the del rey torta works together and it is huge and its great too wonderfully constructed just enough of everything and not too much of anything i also had the watermelon juice interesting huh one strange thing first mexican restaurant ive ever been in that didnt have chips and salsa only real downside is that the service is a bit slow but theyre slammed and deservedly so
__label__1 great for saints and lsu games
__label__1 i was hella skeptical that a phoenix fast food mexican joint could top a mission taqueria rivas pleasantly surprised me i chose the two burritos with chicken meal that came with rice and beans standard but fulfilling rice and refried beans the burrito was a breath of fresh grilled veggies a warm tortilla filled with chicken peppers and onions so simple and yet so mouth watering best part was that the burrito was so big that i got to save the second one for my flight back to sf oh and this whole package was under 7
__label__1 great surprise i have driven by this place several times food was excellent i had the enchantment platter just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming cool cavelike atmosphere inside and fun patio area i will definitely be back and bring out of towners
__label__0 i think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here of which there must be 500 look at the trend all 5s then 23 and a few 4s i hate that first off it bills itself as a steakchop house or american grill whatever that is it is not a steakhouse despite have butcher in the name lets start with the ambiance dont ever sit in the back room it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum also what is up with the tv if i wanted to watch tv while i ate i would stay at home or go to a sports bar next the service it sucked there must have been 20 servers yet service was slow and inattentive i know the place is new but they did not even have a wine list printed when we asked for the wine list they first said they did not have one sitting in the back room i could see the freaking bottles then they sent us the manager who was clueless she then the bar manager who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had he was knowledgeable about wine at least other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well drinks my dad ordered a margarita it was awful we complained to our server who sent over the bar manager the bar manager made him a second one which was passable for that price it should have been great i ordered a draft ipa they were out i got a 22 bottle it was good my mom got a 7 and 7 it was fine now the wine way over priced an average markup is about double it was triple or more here ie a 12 bottle at the store should be about 2024 in a restaurant it is 36 here no value food meh at best the best part of the meal was the cheesemeat plate me and my dad had the ribeye the meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower i liked the sauce my dad did not but the sauce really over powered the steak my mom had the pork and beans she loved it all in all not the worst meal i ever had but no value here dessert i would not know i am allergic to peanuts and true nuts not a single desert was nut free my mom had the peanut butter cup she loved it also they had no dessert wines or any after dinner drinks value 80 a person with food wine and drinks i can think of many other places i could go and get a better meal for that price or less for example we had dinner at the tuck shop the night before the meal was great and drinks and dinner was 80 total
__label__1 excellent service and food enjoyed live music on patio
__label__1 this is a great hole in the wall shop off of val vista rd ive been getting the chicken salad sandwich since 2006 and its the same ever since great cookies and bread are awesome as well
__label__1 chomp this is one mmmghgh good burger sllluuuurrrpp its got a great combination of yumminess with a side of chomp awesomeness the burgers are great and chomp perfect the custard is great lick and diabetic friendly mmmmmmmthey have no sugar added custard i would definitely recommend this place lick
__label__1 5 stars for uniqueness this place has very interesting food and flavors that arent common around here 5 stars for the staff everybody was very fast and friendly 5 stars for coolness of the location and the establishment i mean it is pretty cool that this place is in a nicely redone 100yearold house in a cool part of downtown phoenix parking is a pain though however besides feeling hip cool urban and trendy i also felt hungry and ripped off after leaving sure i could sit there for hours sipping saki and trying every one of their tapas and probably be ok hungerwise but i would not be ok with the 100 tab per person that it would surely be for me this is more of a funinteresting place to go before you go out to dinner
__label__1 the breakfast club is as good as youll find the blueberry pancakes are superb their coffee is beyond description for a change of pace try their eggs benedict southwestern style a great spot within walking distancea beauty
__label__1 went here for the first time a few weeks ago and it was some of the best bbq ive had in arizona the service was great as well the manager stopped by a few times as well as our waiter to make sure everything was good update looks like they went out of business havent been open for two weeks now
__label__1 as promised heres my makeup visit update things improved dramatically since the last time i went firstly our server wasnt an upsell machine in fact she was very polite and concerned about our order mine was particularly attentive with replacing and putting on the side of some ingredients and she and the staff doublechecked with me before and afterward to make sure everything was hunkydory the food was great as always had my first mm calzone and i actually liked it better than the delicious pizza they have no mention of this in my first reviews as i dont recall going to the bathroom but their bathroom is great ha maybe tmi for a food review however really impressed with the privacy of the stalls back to more relevant things i was confused though i suppose not offput about the happy hour rules we went after 10 which is advertised as hh apparently it isnt halfprice appetizers on some nights and instead is a slice of pepperoni or something for 3 not sure i call that a deal but i guess beers being halfoff makes up for it i was kind of disappointed they didnt have fall woodchuck as i went during their fallthemed beers time but i guess its kinda a pussy beer anyway ill qualify myself by saying im more of a straight liquor guy but woodchuck is my guilty pleasure the waitress had a nifty handwritten updated list she kept with her and while im not a beer man i can appreciate the effort in something like that anyway like i said they seem to have really improved here and i definitely recommend them for the food if not the service bon appetit
__label__1 the service was great we had a large group had called prior to make a reservation our table was ready when we arrived they had assigned 2 servers they were both incredibly pleasant attentive our food came out really quickly no one had any complaints i wouldnt say this was authentic mexican food but it doesnt have to be a good time was had by all
__label__1 the lemon grass pork is 2 stars on a generous day disappointing since they tout their vietnamese selections as being specialties the pork was tough and the noodles were more like lo mein than the vermicelli type rice noodles i was expecting portions are certainly generous enough i like that you can make your own rice bowl thats the direction i recommend if you come here
__label__1 this is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company the food is fresh and the service always friendly if you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go fondue is fun if you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening
__label__0 i had such high hopes for this restaurant as i was coming in from out of town and a friend who grew up in scottsdale recommended it was a disappointment the food was just ok nothing special the sticky buns everyone raved up did not come out as an appetizer or even after meal treat oddly came out with our dinner so it was basically over looked the restaurant was not crowded yet we were sat at one of the few tables without a view my biggest problem was the flies they were everywhere and we were seated inside the restaurant not on the patio when you go to an upscale restaurant to celebrate a special occassion who wants to be shooing flies away from their food it was really disgusting and distracting for the money we spent to eat here i felt ripped off we ate at the roaring fork the next night and it was superb so if you are going to be in the area you should consider alternatives who have better food better service and a more pleasing environment dont waste your money on this place
__label__0 this is my first year participating in arizona to sell clothing just wandering how busy its goona be in there little worried can any one reply me
__label__1 food is top notch and within a good price range for a weekend breakfast i dropped a star because its always so crowded theres usually a line to order your food that and theyre closed on sundays its a perfect weekend breakfast how can you be closed on sundays but i eat here all the time
__label__1 today our travels took us to the chandler mall on 10312012 therefore we were near to abuelos for lunch nothing like returning to a restaurant that you found to be very good we arrived after 1pm so we were seated asap we ordered drinks first along with a serving of guacamole nice way to start off lunch my wife ordered the dilla lunch while i ordered the grande burrito lunch special both item arrived on a very hot platewonderful whenever we are dining at another restaurant a hot plate is always expected but all too often the hot plate fails to appear our lunch stay hot until the last bite due to the hot plate service everything was great with the meal and no requested drink refillsalways a sign of great service both restrooms were very clean and serviced many times during the day we highly recommend abuelos for a great lunch or dinner
__label__1 this is my neighborhood grocery store its at the two locations i shop at most its always clean and well stocked and i never have to wait in line for very long
__label__1 we brought the entire family to giuseppes last night for a prethanksgiving meal yes thats right my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today we brought a ton of wine and had a great time franco was our waiter and im guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him that he is the waiter sheila b wrote about in her review too nice eye candy i absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit we usually start with a giuseppes salad and finish with a dessert to share my favorite is the white chocolate tartufa pasquale pictured above is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time since im writing this review on thanksgiving i want to give thanks to pasquale and ristorant giuseppe for all the good times ive had there and all of the good times to come salud
__label__1 the vig uptown is on my list of very favorite places to go in phx ill keep this one simple great food and awesome atmosphere thats chill not pretentious but still super cool keeps me coming back to the vig uptownsweet central phoenix vibe and location i like it that this place is close enough to the central corridor but also close enough if im headed over from scottsdale or other phx hoods happy hour is a great deal with half off all appetizers 5 dollars for any burger and fries on mondays after 4pm to close and a stellar menu of comfort food thats still inventive i adore the wings aka vings the artichoke dip the salads the burgers sweet potato friesand anything ive ever tried here other good things nice patio area thats really indoors for hot phx days fireplace area a bocce ball court the fact that its in a repurposed 1950s bank building with a retro feel and the vig rig on weekends they will pick updrive home if you want to drink a bit only knocked them a star because sometimes the service falls off when theyre busy ive waited way too long more than once just for a salad etc if it was only once or twice i wouldnt have knocked them a starbut theyre usually busy and the service usually isnt very good if they can fix that a bit 5 stars for sure
__label__1 waffle houses are bomb but this one is my favorite not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit there are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise as far as the food the prices are cheap the menu is semialacarte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect this is the waffle house to visit go now do it how good does a waffle sound right now anyways thats right pretty damn good
__label__0 this was by far the worst restaurant experience ive ever had i paid 2000 for a show and dinner i received the show only because it was from an outside source the show was 2 hours long and by the time it was over half the restaurant id say 50 to 80 people still had not been served they didnt have enough menus for people to even order off of some guy in shorts walked around with buckets of silverware wiping them on his shorts then placing them on the table the show started at 700 at 930 i still had no food the people who did get food complained that it was terrible maybe i should be happy i didnt get any food when i asked again about our order the waitress said she would take care of it the guys in the kitchen were overheard saying fk those people no more orders not only did we not get the dinner we already paid for they flat out refused to give us dinner or our money back we ended up at dennys eating eggs at 1100 seriously ive never had such a bad experience in my life can you imagine paying for a dinner then being refused the dinner or a refund unbelievable
__label__1 great prices with great selection great for your everyday shopping needs
__label__1 me and three girlfriends headed to la bocca for happy hour after reading all the wonderful yelp reviews i was really excited on my way there but left feeling underwhelemd for me it felt a little big commercial the decor was kinda cheesy think red leather chairs pier1 important wall sconces even a vip looking lounge in red velour hardly original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic wine bar in my opinion if youre a regular at chain restaurants youll probably think this is a cute place call me a snob whatever lets talk about the wine list at this wine bar it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red not ideal for a wine bar then we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves knowing we were sharing the plate maybe the waitress should have clued us in we ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety i do have to say the bruchetta was good we were clearly there for happy hour on a wednesday night which i do love goes until 630pm but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round there was no grace period so we paid full price we did notice that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim so maybe 12 price have the wine dont get me wrong the place is cute enough would def seem like a fancy date night place if i were still in college id go again with girlfriends but wont be racing back with my husband i wish we would have tried more food because that seems to be the key to this place ambiance and service are good not great oh and the music could use some updating the playlist was eh interesting maybe its my love of postino or maybe its because i was on mill avenue i was instantly judging the place
__label__1 meh met up with a few friends here and sat on the patio on a saturday night around 8 there are no heaters which would be ok if it was a nice fall day or a summer night but i was a bit cold towards the end there is indoor seating as well so this shouldnt be a deal breaker i ordered a few nice glasses of red one pinot noir and one petite syrah i ordered the tuna salad and the bf ordered the grilled cheese it was just ok and so was the service our plates sat on the table for over 20 minutes after we were finished before they were cleared cute place good music not a huge variety on the menu just salads and sandwiches i would likely go to humble pie next door next time while in the area which is how we spotted the main ingredient in the first place
__label__1 overall i liked this place and glad it is in the neighborhood the carne asada burrito was good and the ceviche was pretty tasty however it seems that this is about all there is to the menu i was not a fan of the setup of the restaurant it was way too crowded yes it was lunch but the flow could have been a lot better overall i will return when in the mood for carne asada hopefully the kinks will get worked out over time and until then i look forward to supporting a local restaurant
__label__1 im not a fan of ice cream i just dont find it appealing and its too high in caloriessaturated fat however i do love frozen yogurt and ironically its much less fattening yet more satisfying at 25 calories an ounce golden spoons is the best around there have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog you also can get more than one flavor combined they also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from from gummy bears to lowfat brownies even though their yogurt is nonfat and low calorie adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories i suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles adds less than 50 calories or if you like fruit go with that
__label__1 just as good a pizzeria bianco but with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours granted there may still be a wait here but you arent fighting tourist for tables at this joint its more of a local fav fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust personally a big fan of the garden seating there was a longer than normal wait for the food however the server was very attentive and i thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden i would not recommend this place for a quick meal but its perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation
__label__0 slices pizza is pretty good not the best though but if you are on mill ave its the best pizza option unos is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in phoenix if the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars if you are in tempe a much better pizza place is red devil pizza about 5 minutes south
__label__1 this review is for gils catering which is fantastic our perfect event for a new product launch needed to be casual but tasty and high quality gils was all of these things the food presentation is pretty without pretension everything was fantastic best of all gil worked with us to plan an event within our budget fare is traditional with a tasty twist our group loved the chimis taquitos enchiladas and especially the chips we expected 2 servers and 4 showed up including gil they over delivered in every sense
__label__1 consistently great service pretty standard food quality for a high end chain have really enjoyed this location both when busy and quiet cocktails arent particularly exciting or strong but a great wine selection makes up for it best way to describe the experience consistent
__label__1 self service good mix n match favors and lots of goodies be careful the bowls are big and you can easily pay more for a single serving than a gallon of breyers at the grocery store very dog friendly place they will bring out a bowl of water and a small softserve with dog treats stuck in it for your little dog
__label__1 great flavors even though there arent many to choose from fresh fruit is such an awesome feature as most places are def not and limited to the healthy choices of topping i visit as often as i can
__label__1 this store made me feel like i had died and went to fabric heaven there is just so much beautiful wonderful amazing fabric i dropped a pretty penny but ive already used some of my perfect fabric for great projects the place is clean the staff is super friendly and patient especially with newbies like me when i brought 10 different reams of fabric up and had to stop and really think about how much i needed patience came with a smile it seems like everything even the high end designers are around 10yard if you get bogged down with all the fabric that you are falling in love with they have a cute little table set up with these funny little signs that say get your paws off my fabric which made me chuckle maybe im turning into an old lady who loves silly stuff like that despite the somewhat sketchy location 35th ave sew and vac is my new goto for fabric
__label__1 i was contacted by the manger at this location cause of my bad review i am really for proactive owners i really need to go back to this location to give them another try since the first time i went there it was really good i was given a gift card to wipe out what i paid for the last meal as kinda of do over i will be back anthony and i will let you know how my next visit is
__label__1 i have been through plenty of airports around the world and i have to say that this one is on the better end it is easy to navigate clean from what i have experienced and makes getting to and returning rental cars a breeze as in most airports those who are not used to recent travel really hold up the security check line i would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and i held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech but we were all able to make our flights a word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their fourlegged friends allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by your pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day please consider leaving your pets at home an unplanned trip to the er as a result of your inconsideration should be your responsibility what do you say about that health care providers in all my travels this has been the only time i have been stuck behind the hairiest cat i have ever seen in my life because its owners had more baggage than humanly possible to manage clueless to others distress as the owners their pet left wheezing sneezing itching gasping travelers in its wake are you from naperville
__label__0 yeahnotsomuch sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait or the chaos or the hype or the attitude from the morons who work there other things that are terrible about sprinkles include the cupcakes are not that great i ordered two the vanilla was okay the cinnamon was dry and chalky and i really disliked it this place is a disorganized mess there is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process my friends and i were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes just stupid the owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions no sane person could possibly work here without being like umthere might be a better way to do this also the employees were rude did i mention dumb so get this i attempted to order a bottle of water i told the clerk its 100 degrees outside i walked there and im realllllllly thirsty the idiot at the counter told me you can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it i pointed out that the water was right there and there wasnt anyone currently paying or using the register couldnt she just sell me a water she said no and proceeded to write down my order just the word water on a cupcake order slip she then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could hand me the water and then ring me up i was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so i got really ghetto on her ass and was all like oh helllllltotheno i said its quite simple just hand me the water and i will hand you money end of discussion there are the actual words out of the mouth she looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 54 110 lbs of fury thankfully she handed me my water so i did not have to stab her which was good because i was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone i must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion and im mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes yo
__label__1 great place to grab a coffee with decent prices and a great atmosphere for sitting down to do some work or catch up with a friend would definitely recommend
__label__1 note i only had takeout and it was brought to me by my boss she rules she got me a hummusgrilledmarinated chicken combo it has 3 different hummuseses ha roasted red pepper jalapeno and plain ole hummus they are sectioned off in the big plastic container which rules for my ocd as i dont like my food touching in the center is a pile a total monton of grilled chicken its got some sort or spicy rub on it but not too much kick it had been marinated too and tenderi think this is the most tender chicken i have ever had it made my own tender spots as juicy as the chicken was im not big on pita so instead she got me a side of cukes this thing weighs a ton and ive been eating it for 2 hours i have made a mess in my make me yelp boyshorts
__label__1 great librarytake your canned food to donate all during april and they wave off your fines great cause great deal and now fine free
__label__1 had the pleasure of enjoying house of tricks last night for the second time in the past twelve months with a party of six i was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices the restaurant found in tempe near asu is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating the outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of treesgreenery the setting works quite well our party was seated immediately and without problem the night was off to a solid start our waitress jamie was both friendly and courteous jamie had a great understanding of the menu the specials and especially the wine her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went i had the pork belly on jamies suggestion other choices within our party included the salmon cake sweetbreads two ways and the scallops i thought the pork belly was great it had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed the scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly the sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown as a lover of sweetbreads i have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation these were just not that great they werent cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking this would be the only lacking dish of the evening for the entree i had the pork osso bucco this was a real treat cooked evenly tender and tasty other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna the salmon and the duck the tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied my companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish she found the duck slightly fatty all around the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned with little room left for dessert we ordered three selections for the table to share all were good and once again our plates were cleaned off the dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces all in all this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service i would eat here again and recommend you to do the same
__label__1 this is my first review on yelp my wife and i were looking for a place we could take the kids for icecream tonight after visiting bass pro shops did a search on yelp found this place ive got to say ive never tried gelato before but my wife thought it looked good i got peanut butter and banana the wife got pb and choc oreo and my kids got oreo and choc chip as my 5 yr old said this place is off the hook we will definitely come back
__label__0 my wife and i have going to this restaurant on thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice a couple weeks ago i went there for the usual but there was an nfl game and a world series game on and the restaurant was busy i put my name in and waited for my wife and the table 30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available hostess said i cant seat you unless your other party shows up first i called my wife she cancelled hostess would not seat me as a singleterriblehostess did not tell me this when i first put my name in wont be going to any of the zipps ever again
__label__1 tip 1 to mesagateway fliers this is the only bar at the airport so live itlove it food is great the burgers can be made lowcarb especially great this gurl tip 2 food can be ordered to go
__label__0 brought a group to metro for brunch made the reservation a month ago called three days ago to update and ask to be outside and people arrived and were told there was no reservation finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when i asked for our tables outside and they couldnt accommodate having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic not enough menus slow horrible drinks no silverware soup was burnthow do you burn soup attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us i host events all over the valley and never have i experienced service as horrible as i did at metro they have recently changed management unfortunately the great reviews i read when i made the reservation dont hold true anymore update 1182010 since my first review i received a 50 gift certificate from the management of metro i decided to go for dessert last friday night with 5 of my friends i knew i couldnt just go with one other person it had to be a group to show what they could do we arrived at 915 and were seated on the patio i met the general manager and she was pleasant enough i never saw her again there was no one seated inside and the patio was half full jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu we ordered beignets apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight the beignets and apple bread pudding were good the triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section
__label__0 mediocre bland low quality food topped off with painfully slow service i worked in the neighborhood and continued to return occasionally just in case its gotten better for reasons i could never fathom once the plate of abysmal food was placed on the table the salsa and rice are usually good but thats the most i have to offer
__label__1 jan ross has one of the best selections of crystals ive seen they literally had every crystal i was looking for and i subsequently left as a satisfied customer friendly staff too
__label__1 ok guys and gals too i know size isnt everything but omg this place has crazy size portions and i loooove it we ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms 12 orders and still the servings were huge six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate i have ever seen serving an appetizer they were great and tasty but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that the calamari was decent could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce but for those who dont like a lot of fan fare with their food this would be perfect classic calamari with classic sauce we loved the stella artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim just how i like them for our entrees we ordered the baked ziti and sausage and the rigatoni d both of them were absolutely fantasticyumm and both were huge the baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in very smart for those with little ones the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well their chicken fingers are home made the pickiest of adults would eat these things no french fries home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets this is the kids menu our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding great leather booths linen napkins white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth elegant but not stuffy guys could go in with tshirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up you can as well with out feeling overly so i am definitely going here again what a find
__label__1 i was working in the area and craving a healthy salad for lunch my usual love affair salad place was too far so my colleague and i decided to try jasons deli hed gone there for sandwiches many times and never tried the salad bar for about 750 after tax you can get a pretty good selection of veggies dressings even a few premade pasta salad options they also have crackers and mini muffins the salad area seemed clean and well stocked there were enough tables to sit even during the lunch rush
__label__1 a most unexpected gem if you are a wine drinker fabulous flights great selection i cant say much more other than awesome
__label__1 finally veered away from my usual sandwich or cold rice noodles and ordered the beef phodarn it was good
__label__1 great customer service perfect dining area this lightly dimmed pizzeria is nothing like the other high top table pizza places the staff and waitress are really friendly with along great customer service and i am picky with people who serve at restaurants this place is great for family or even with friends to get a great bite to eat i ordered the side chef erics caesar salad and thin crust cheese with pepperoni i highly recommend for great pizza however the guy who was going to bring my pizza dropped itbut made it up by giving me nicoles notable chocolate chip cookies
__label__1 pho is great every time service is fast and friendly potstickers are the best i have ever had and they are only 350 plus 10 discount for intel employees
__label__1 the place is nothing special you can even think there is nothing going on there as it is almost hidden once you are in you still wont believe there is something worthy sit and try one of their gyros hummus or the vegetarian combo all tasty and well served after that you can check and buy some interesting to impress your friends next time
__label__1 harvest hash is incredible ask for their house made bbq sauce on the side vegan raspberry banana bread french toast sooooo good its a busy place on a saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly a gem
__label__1 let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist its epic weeks before an appointment i start having nightmares thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat i require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning the sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off basically every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years enter dr marcia blazer i read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in scottsdale i literally googled dentists for anxious patients and her name popped up her website appeared too good to be true they offered nitris plus offered non invasive options for dental procedures double plus and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear i went in for my first visit a cleaning and exam and i was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel they were warm and friendly and put me at ease immediately during the cleaning my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapypointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline how happy was i when they used an air abrasion tool insteadfelt like a cool stream of water on your teeth and bam theyre clean they were so calming that when i was informed that i had 2 cavities i didnt even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in fast forward two weeks to my filling appointment i had requested nitris hey i was feeling better but still super anxious which they had all set up in the room for me when i walked in now heres my favorite part as i sat in the chair the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvds and asked me what movie i would like to watch during the procedurewhat so i picked a lighthearted comedy 50 first dates i was then given noise eliminating headphones to use goodbye horrible drilling sound nitris hello happy gas and a few hand signals to recognize if i was supposed to open or close my mouth and we were off she didnt try to maintain conversation soooo annoying when dentists do that and before i knew it she was done and i was disappointed because my movie wasnt quite over i was even told that had my dentist not needed the room i was in for another patient that i would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie i have had several interactions with this office since then regarding billing and follow up and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them i highly recommend this office to anyone
__label__1 i have been to mabels a few times now and i think it is a pretty stellar place the food is awesome try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs and the drinks are strong the ambiance is nice and cozy and i think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends the staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in snottsdale last night i was wowed by mabels we had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there for free but generously offered to donate 20 of the bar tab to the cause the service was great that night and they earned a fan for life thanks mabels for being so cool youre a breath of fresh air
__label__1 i always just get one thing from vietnamese places and its their rice dish with grilled pork chop and egg cake this place does it goooood you get a reasonable amount for the price and the fish sauce is just right
__label__0 ive always said if the guacamole chips and salsa arent good the food is not likely to be good either i was right guacamole was not very good at all same with the salsa rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the biltmore i expected so much better just as a note when it comes to mexican food im super critical this place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the midwest
__label__1 old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection you will pay more but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials often there are coupons for bogo or a few bucks off your purchase they also have a good selection of beer and wine side dishes and some supplies for home bbq and smoking after reading the other reviews i know my hubby and i need to try the jerky we always enjoy shopping at von hansons
__label__1 i didnt stay here but patronized their restaurant the servers were very polite and accommodating they frequently refilled our drinks and aimed to serve by making sure the fireplaces were working its a nice place to hang at if you have a reason to be here
__label__1 i have not been bowling in 24 yearsso you can imagine i was worried but this place is clean and fresh on certain nightsmondayand a few others you pay a 500 cover chargethen everything is 100 food drinks games and most important bowling games the instructions were easy we got shoes in our size then went and picked out a ball lots to choose from lots of fun it was a 2000 night for 2 of us the workers are very helpful and friendly bathrooms were also clean i did not see them spray the shoes with lysol so that was a little grossbut other than that it was a great time
__label__1 watched the ignite phoenix 7 viewing party here on friday night thanks for hosting had a lovely americano while i watched great drinks and cool interior the other guests seems to be talking about their food as being very good this is a little out of my neighborhood so dont know how often i will be able to stop by but if i am ever remotely close and need a little java this is a great little spot
__label__0 this is one of the franchise store of ritz camera in chandler the stores staffs are nice however their photo lab is miss leading they make the price in very small fonts and hanging on the ceiling for the first time user to print photos in the lab i was charged for 45 for just few 4x6 and 8x10 print without signin as member i asked for canceling order prior they print the photos i was told too late even its still in one of their store pc for ordering prints since they are franchise i should be able to return or exchange the accessories i bought for my nikon d70s camera in different store i was told no i can only exchange or return to the stores i purchase them i will not buy anything from them again
__label__1 wow practically half price on everything compared to the chain stores staff is always very friendly and helpful and ive literally saved hundreds of dollars since i discovered this store just under a year ago
__label__1 person 1 so where do you want to go to lunch person 2 hmmm im not sure person 1 want to go to paradise person 2 naaah weve been there three times recently person 1 what about subway person 2 im so damned tired of sandwiches person 1 well heres qdoba person 2 qdoba okay i havent been there in a while we can get in and out pretty quickly and get back to work thats pretty much how it is nobody really plans to go out and eat at qdoba its one of those places you decide to go to on the fly or because youve eaten everywhere else the mexifood is fair nothing special nothing bad nothing to distinguish it theres tons of mexican joints within ten miles that are better but qdobas here in this strip mall havent eaten here in a while and dont want to drive any further this will make a nice alternative and then youll be good on this place for another six months or so
__label__1 i didnt have a fully immersed portlands experience so perhaps i am selling them a bit short but as far as my experience went it was aok we stopped in because of its proximity to the light rail and our need for alcoholic refreshment we had a couple beers small selection but we found something we really liked and a glass of wine reasonably priced tasty the service was fine the prices fine everything was fine and thats just it does fine merit a yay im a fan four star review no it does not maybe the food is out of this world maybe at night this place lights up and sparkles in a way that the daytime cannot convey its on the light rail so i may give it another attempt but on first glance portlands is just aok
__label__1 first off let me congratulate ohso on being open for business i was thrilled to see another local watering hole open in the neighborhood i frequent arcadia tavern and jts often and will most likely add ohso to the rotation upon entering ohso i remember my first impression being is this place really ready to be open for business i noticed a few unfinished details on the building maybe intentionally that left me wondering if this place decided to open overnight simple said i appreciate good service there was a lack of this at ohso we were not greeted when we walked in there was a group of employees talking at the host stand and i had to approach them before they recognized our group they quickly said it was open seating and got back to their converstaion we grabbed seats in a booth in the bar area we probably sat there for about 5 mins trying to make sense of the various colored menus strewn across the table as we were all very thirsty for a cold beer we decided to finally order at the bar someone eventually came by after some of our party left 2 of us moved up to the bar and asked the bartender a few questions no one seemed to know what was going on everyone appeared to be extremely busy with busy work instead of helping the patrons seemed like a lack of training with the staff overall i think this place has the potential to be a cool spot and truly hope it does well if i could offer a few suggestions they would be 1 have a dedicated hosts greet people at the front door take a hint from arcadia tavern i have never walked in there and not been greeted by a friendly smile 2 get the music in order if you want to a progressivehip local brewery you are going to have to do better than a killers album that was popular 4 years ago 3 you have something that people wantbeer its great service and attention to detail that will keep patrons coming back i look forward to my next visit and i hope some of these kinks are worked out
__label__1 almost as good as the original boomers wasnt quite there for me but maybe because i was there on a sunday and the help clearly wasnt into working that day cant say i blame them though anyways same good menu selections good prices sliders were tasty but not as good as at the original boomers needless to say ill be back and try them again these guys have awesome chicago dogs and it would be a shame not to try them here
__label__1 i cant think of a better thai rest in phx consistently good food and service they have thai staples like rice paper rolls tom ka gai and pad thai as well as more creative items such as crispy mango fish average thai food pricing free parking there are a good number of tables so dont let a short line dissuade you like any rest scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood boisterous din in the main room when busy
__label__1 i had lunch here today with co workers and it was absolutely delicious cannot wait to go back gain
__label__0 i was here for a conference and saw their sign for a 10 lunch special which wasnt available that day took over an hour to just get a lunch salad the waiter had major attitude avoid this place
__label__1 we had a great dinner there on saturday we were celebrating my aunts birthday and we ordered from the regular and special menus i had a truly wonderful chicken madiera my hubby had meat loaf which is always a tell for a good place my uncle had fried haddock which was crunchy and not at all greasy and my aunt also had the chicken madiera which was forktender we also had great service attentive without being too much and we completely enjoyed our meal we will definitely visit this location again
__label__1 the best fish tacos period and i hate chain restaurants
__label__1 whats all the fuss im not sure what folks compare this chain too the dead duck inn joes local chinese gag house are those places that great sooo fresh and delicious not in my days premade sitting around and heavy oil is what i see from most other establishments even those touted by friends maybe its because they know george from behind the counter its not pei wei pei wei is a quick fresh and inexpensive gift from heaven even the hard to please yelper has to admit the multiple options you have to modify your meal should give you no excuse not to love what you order the food is fresh and prepared to order even fried rice is made to order the sauces are made from scratch and are a combination of quality chinese ingredients chili paste fresh garlic scallions bean curd and a bounty of fresh chinese vegetables go yon china will serve you premade sauces with no punch and lots of giggle the atmosphere at pei wei is great black and dark red with glossy graphics and all sorts of chinese even with the stand in line style of dining makes me hungry just thinkin about the joint however to me its a take out ferrari call in swipe my card and off i go sure its not changs still its better than the local dead duck inns food stained art with a chinese new year paper place mat of course im looking at the healthier options a chinese food place may have to offer and pei wei lifts the bar in multiple sets get your chicken steamed go brown rice add extra vegetables or go vegetarian still you may complainoh is it too salty or too sweet give me a break this is chinese food and you wont find msg so if you dont want spicy salty or sweet have a meal from bland of the rising sun but if you want a highly under rated treati ask you to open your mind to this familiar spot for clean fresh made to order and if you like healthy chinese food
__label__1 stayed here with my girlfriend for a radiohead show and a get away weekend from work got the hotel for the amenities which were great we played tennis enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool great cocktails to include the tequila sunrise and some light putt putt outside our cottage the room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio the room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days our room was made up between 45 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out they came by at 830not sure what the problem was there we also had to call about our ac after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens you are probably wondering what if anything was wrong the only issue we had was the conciergenightmare no help whatsoever called several times both girlfriend and i and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google i have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research all in all great trip and a nice and above par stay i would certainly stay here again if i can get my girl to go with me
__label__0 the reviews were so good that my friend and i had to check it out we were very disappointed this morning while trying to eat breakfast and swatting tons of flies they were everywhere on us our food the other customers and this was inside the egg sandwiches were served on hamburger buns shaped like rolls i could have went next door to get one just like it at mcdonalds not surprised people from ahwatukee like this place it looks nice but the food is soso
__label__1 drunk people go here service is good depending who you get the burger according to one arik b can not taste his burger when ask the server how come my friend arik b cant taste his burger why you had to be there to laugh what a fun night dont order the pancakes they are not very good the chicken strips were aok
__label__1 i am a regus member and could get wait here since i could use my membership card its a great place situated on 3rd floor with awesome city view complimentary menu is refreshing cordial staff quiet and relaxed environment many tv screens and seatings to get comfortable with
__label__0 great at first then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 2030 minutes put everyones bill on my tab i opened a tab so this wouldnt happen then they made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what then they over charged us by quit a bit we had to flag someone fdown from napkins and plates and it took a few trys for a water and to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long there were three bartenders for what i handle myself at a bar on a daily basis no sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager he pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting or deal just to close a check kind of a joke really
__label__1 cute decorwho doesnt like ikea attentive service we ordered a couple beers and the sweet potato tots i decided on the ahi burger and the veggie burger and my sister went with the two sandwiches pbnj and the grilled cheese everything was delicious unfortunately for us we arrived about 30 min prior to happy hour but we managed to get a couple beers at the 3 happy hour price ive been here once before and since then it looks like they added a few items to the menu ill have to go back to try the shrimp poboy and the red snapper burger
__label__0 stopped here for lunch with my bff today nowhere to park forced to valet meh love the atmosphere here classy decor beautiful patio everything on the menu looked delicious i had a hard time choosing between many foods that i love crab cakes goat cheese crepes i wanted something lighter so i ordered the oriental chicken salad in the meantime our drinks were brought to the table bff pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it the question is who left it there dont know gross this was pointed out to a server not ours because she had not returned to our table our server brought out a new iced tea she was polite but not necessarily apologetic when our meal was delivered to the table bff pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich she asked for no tomatoes the server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate she came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out so i sat with my salad and waited to eat until bff got her meal it took a good 510 minutes for her new sandwich to come out bff raved about the dressing on her side salad my salad was fine but nothing to rave about especially not for 13 the ingredients were fresh but the shredded chicken that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast to be honest i prefer shredded chicken which is why i had decided on that particular salad disappointing the server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert we replied no thank you and she said something like oh come on are you sure again we declined but i really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch the topper 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their carsa 10 minute wait just to leave the place i would hesitate to come back but that menu is just so damn tempting
__label__1 great food good service salsa is the best enchiladas are very good i dont know what they put in the sauce but damn is it good no better mexican food anywhere in scottsdale
__label__1 mmm dirty hipster bars let me count the ways in which i love you you are cheap we had 2 stellas you are interesting local art on the walls that im told changes regularly you are full of pretension people watching is always worth the price of admission you are friendly like minded souls can smell each other out if you are in the roosevelt district i highly recommend stopping in for happy hour its cheap and hipstery both words have been used to describe me so i am naturally predisposed to this place
__label__1 my wife called to have our vent cleaned since our dryer was taking over an hour to dry an average load our appointment was scheduled for 8 am not for 812 as most places he showed up at 8 and had the vent clean and working well excellent customer service and very friendly thanks again gary
__label__1 not being a big fan of chain restaurants i wasnt super excited to eat here last night i was however starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at manuels omg i loved it the salsas especially the hot the chips the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions and most of all the chilaquiles i love chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until i opened up manuels menu and there they were just how i like them so good i wouldve licked the dish they were served in if i wasnt so full afterwards jd had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating it was so good though that im craving it again today we will definitely be back
__label__0 this place made me remember why i dont live in scottsdale anymore
__label__1 i first heard about gangplank at the arizona entrepreneurship conference last year since then i have been a regular there and the people that cowork or work there are some of the most inspirational ones i know and are passionate about bringing startup culture to phoenix area the companies that anchor gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from gangplank jr for kids to learn programming to the wednesday brown bag talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using twitter as a resource for news leads gangplank rocks nuff said iamtimhardy
__label__1 i was definitely expressed with their buffet i had been craving indian food for quite a while but since it can be a bit expensive having to order all the dishes separately i was determined to find a place with a lunch buffet nearby to give it a try i was lucky enough to find this place which i noticed had fairly good reviews on yelp this place is definitely nicer and bigger compared to other indian buffets id been to it has a wide seating area and nicely arranged tables the buffet had a great selection and i was able to try new dishes that id never tried before everything was delicious tandoori chicken was dry but then again ive yet to experience it moist and juicy at a buffet the garlic naan bread was soft and warm so good service was excellent server was attentive and polite my glass of water was never empty will definitely be coming back
__label__1 excellent cheap mexican food that tastes as good as any mexican restaurant
__label__1 the chicken was unreal good and the cornbread just as reviewers stated was heavenly it was light and very good
__label__1 great martinis and they even have absynthe if youre looking to get crazy great looking modern style bar and lounge
__label__1 i had my doubts about cream stereo lounge beacause i didnt like the name of the place and i heard that they played a lot of house and techno music ive been sick of all the scottsdale staples like myst axis six pcl etc so i thought i would give cream a try and i ended up liking the place a lot everyone there was very friendly and the dj played a lot of good songs to dance to if youre sick of going to the same bars in old town give cream a try
__label__1 i have been to this place a few times over the past few years i get the same thing the pollo fundido it satisfies my mexican cravings the atmosphere is fun maze like service is decent and like most places if something is wrong they are quick to fix it this is a great local restaurant i love how it lacks the ultra corporate feel of most mainstream joints great mexican
__label__1 we just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at pita jungle next door its a selfservice yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once youve finished your creation the offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate but also less traditional offerings like irish mint and red velvet were also available they offer a taste of any of the products and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container they also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation i had a combination of the irish mint and latte yogurts with a couple of toppings the yogurt itself was smooth creamy and well flavored well likely be dropping by here in the future
__label__0 ok im giveing del taco one more chance i go in what is your best chicken idem um burrito or taco he asks have you had the burrito noi havent had ethier have any one eaten anything here i ask the rest of the resturant crewthey all shake there heads no ok so even if the food was discounted or free no one should ever eat del tacoregardless i did eat a burrito and my worst fears where confirmedi could have dumpster dove at a taco bell and gotten better food feed me bad food once shame on youfeed me bad food 4 times shame on me
__label__1 one of my earliest memories of phoenix concerns waking up under the eucalyptus trees that used to cover most of what is now the business park and shopping center next to what i will call the new duck the old one was far larger and would have been about where the starbucks is now of course im talking about 1973 here so i digress anyway the current abbreviated duck remains one of my favorite places to relax and hang out in phoenix now i have a little one who enjoys running through the grass near the patio and socializing with the other youngsters that frequent the place the bar features interesting wines by the bottle and glass most nights the bytheglass happy hour special is something rather interesting in contrast to the red or white found in other joints the interior of the small bar is dark like a cellar in fact you can find a variety of atmospheres in and out of the duck and the sandwiches yes try them all very very good
__label__1 had my snaaz 5k walk for education very beautiful park clean and would be perfect for walking a dog theres lots of parking and also there is a desert in downtown phoenix how nice real arizona feel i would definitely take my parents or my aunt for a nice walk on a fall morning
__label__1 only three stars wowmaybe it was the ambiance that sucks overall herei dont know i actually didnt go here myself it was my wife she brought me home a cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spoteven lukewarm all i know is that meal was better as a leftover than a lot of the fresh ones ive had at taquerias around the tri city area makes me wonder how it would taste if it were nice and hot okaychallenge accepted ill let you know
__label__1 the grilled chicken sandwich hold the mayo add ketchup and mustard and the fries off the chain minus one star because it should stay open later
__label__1 be sure to save up for the 3000 coffee machine they demod for me nuts i could never imagine paying as much for a coffee machine as i would for a used car i am really wanting to take one of the cooking classes they offer here soon maybe hoping for a sur le table groupon
__label__0 walgreens has the best nuts however they recently changed their prices and only give a cheaper 2for on the halves and pieces and they upped the price again on the whole cashews i will be shopping elsewhere
__label__0 i think matts has had its 5 minutes of fame note to owners your food is good enough your staff is great so please save your money and move to a better location right now youre next to a rundown hotel with police baracade tape all over the placethe local residents panhandling all the waiting customers outside your place seriously just sad wont go again wont recommend it either good luck this summer the heat will melt all your waiting area customers out
__label__0 i was really disappointed with my local baja fresh tonight the lobby salsa bar and even drink station were very dirty and unkept to top that off my salad had old dark colored guacamole and limp lettuce i hope they read this and will do a better job at cleaning up
__label__1 ive traveled to phoenix several times for business trips and stayed at the ritz true foods was my go to spot in phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel i love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food my favorite dishes are the edamame dumplings and the miso glazed black cod it was often hard to get out of work for lunch so coming to true foods at the end of the day was always a treat i only wish they had one in san francisco
__label__1 if you work in an office and have to dress business casual ny co is your place to shop some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not they have modest cute stylish business casual clothes at an affordable price i dont think i have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice i cant stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is see my review on coach in lv lastly they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness everything is always really different and fun so i cant resist and usually walk out with several pieces the next time you are trying to find a place to shop try ny co there is something for everybody
__label__1 burnt china china caught fire
__label__0 i give this review a total 1 star if i was able to i would have rated no stars at all i would never reccomend anyone to live here the office staff is horrible and made me feel uncomfortable the whole year i lived there based on their mistakes i can not express how disappointed i am with the way that they have treated me
__label__1 i ate here once while crudo was still in its scottsdale location and i raved about it and vowed to come back although the strange location in a salon delayed that return then crudo disappeared and i wondered how a place that fed me one of my best meals in phoenix could disappear in a town supposedly full of foodies now it has reappeared and in a better location oh joy
__label__1 if you have to travel to phoenix yay then chances are you have to travel through sky harbor boo theres also a decent chance youll consider traveling on southwest boo but as airlines boo in sky harbor boo go you can do worse than southwest im not a huge fan of southwest although ill give credit where credit is due and that bags fly free thing is genius combine one of my least favorite carriers with what is probably my least favorite airport and youve got a recipe for disaster but somehow it works out in southwests benefit the gates are just as hard to reach for swest as other carriers and youre not banished to the edge of the universe for checkin or for baggage claim theyve got a decent presence here so you may actually find a human who can help should you have a problem yes they may leave you stranded on the runway for a while in 100 degree plus weather check or force you to dash across the airport with late arriving flights check but every once in a while its a painless operation
__label__1 this is one of my new favorites places to bring people who are from out of town its something different that i think real foodies will enjoy although the restaurant itself is dark and cramped its worth going to over and over again i ordered the shepherds pie pasty it was very filling and delicious although i had to wait 20 minutes for it it was worth waiting for a fresh out of the oven pasty but if youre ever in a rush a good thing about this place is that you can call ahead and request for them to start cooking your pasty so that it is ready to be served once you arrive
__label__1 the service was fantastic there was a nice warm lady attending the shop and the gelato was awesome as always yummy chocolate caramel fudge brownie
__label__1 i crave breakfast food all the time but i want something more than an ihop or dennys not only is crackers co way better than a mainstream breakfast place its actually cheaper too i ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing it had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than i imagined their country potatoes are awesome and have nice brown crunchy edges i went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food this place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste plus they serve breakfast all day on fridays saturdays and sundays i cant wait to go back
__label__0 first off the restaurant is dim and dark i thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain the waiter there did not have a smile and didnt seem freindly it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at the service sucked ass i mean come on there was only two tables including mines and 394 of the time he didnt check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill like seriously are you that lazy bun bo hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side pho had a rancid smell noodles in my sisters bun thit nuong were hard and watery seemed like they were super old overall i wouldnt recommend to anybody
__label__1 well if you want california fancy cuisine this aint your place if you are seeking downhome country cookin this is your spot anyway there are no cracker barrels in california the lunches for the two of us were great very good service on a busy day our meals were exactly as ordered many choices at cracker barrel and the food was hot the prices are unbelievably reasonable as inexpensive as a fast food restaurant the servers are super and extremely courteous and well trained
__label__1 i tried to give full marks to lolos having heard all the hype realize that i am coming from louisiana and also new york city where one can obtain the namesake specialty rather easily and in variations instead of telling you all the cliche things that you will need to know about lolos i am going to tell you why ultimately i did not drink the koolaid on a 5 star rating better pricing is the missing star i found the place to be on the expensive side for what you get it is perhaps a part of my relationship towards this home cooking that makes me feel this way but please note service was greatbut dont plan on being in and out for a quick lunch unless to do a to go order also these waffles are wonderfully flavored i detected a nice hint of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon the chicken is nicely seasonednothing greasy about this batch i will also say that if you are not used to koolaid or if you are like me and used to be able to water that thing down until the original colour had faded by simply adding batches and batches of sugar to it you will be in for a diabetic shock heres what to do ask for a side glass of water and then inject some of the koolaid into the water my favorite is grape drink i am hoping to get back to lolos to try their gizzards i had the basics on this trip and it is really worth the return trip bring your friends and go and eat late there on friday night
__label__1 great food fresh crispy veggies excellent service i love the luau pork but its kind of salty even for me considering i love salty food mango iced tea is very refreshing and key lime pie is gooood i have tried the tofu but it has been hit or miss the way they cook iti like it crispier or as crispy as you can get tofu
__label__1 i was pleasantly surprised to find the phoenix public market across the parking deck from the cronkite school of journalism and mass communication its too bad its not located on the ground floor of the school replacing the space currently occupied by subway it would be much healthier for the students i had their breakfast protein shake which was awesome even though it was 6 i ended up having two while the shop is not as big as a whole foods it does provide the organic and healthy staples while serving fresh salads pastries and different types of chocolates i didnt get to purchase the local bran of organic ice cream which seems to be popular maybe next time im back in phoenix i also liked their little coffee shop in the back room which is separate from the main shopping area giving you a bit of quiet to read a book or check your email lastly all the staff are quirky yet incredibly friendly they offered up suggestions for local things to do and were generally helpful overall love this place i wish it a long and successful life the world needs more phoenix urban markets
__label__1 my sweet tooth was yelling at me i had to stop in four times to date and each time i try something different other than the cheese curds which where just ok each visit was for the frozen custard very rich and creamy a little goes a looooong way i have tried a small berry sundae a pineapple malt and a small black cherry cheesecake concrete mixer the sundae by far has been my favorite i love the simplicity the berries were not overly sweet strangely artificially thickened the malt was nice and malty which i really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly now the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich maybe it was because i decided to go with a cheesecake flavor to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor it was very tart like cream cheese about as tart as a good greek yogurt with small bits of graham crumbs swirled through and of course the blackberry flavor
__label__1 this is a fancy fine dining restaurant with a casual feel the food is definitely under priced for most of the summer drinks are cheap and food is half off for the all day happy hour to entice the locals during the winter you cant get into this place it is packed so reservation is recommend the food is described as american southwest the best three choices to have for the first visit is the famous bigass burger green chile pork stew lamb fondue these choices will hit the spot and hit the wallet for 10 bucks with tip a person
__label__1 i had no idea they were open for lunch perfect since the boy and i were down town during lunch the other day we stopped in around 230 inthe afternoon no wait i couldnt even believe it i hadnt eaten there since i was a little girl but it was just as good as i remember we got a couple beers and split the margarita pizza it was sooo yummy perfectly crispy on the edges and lots of flavor the service was a tini bit slow but no big deal we loved it if you want great pizza and dont want to wait the normal 3 hours during dinner you should hit up pizzaria bianco while the sun is still up less wait time if at all enjoy
__label__1 this is in a really cute part of chandler ive driven by a million times but never paid attention to the all the restaurants we went here for lunch based on the great reviews it received on yelp i cant really add much more to the other reviews but just wanted to be one more person to say that the food is delicious service was excellent great ambiance music too
__label__1 we were in az visiting out for thanksgiving and really wanted so go az mexican food but had to go to a place with a full bar for some margaritas this place came up on yelp and looked interesting so we figured we would give it a try the food was pretty good my son had a cheese crisp wife had beef enchiladas and a chicken taco motherinlaw had pork tamales and i had the beef green chile they gave us to big baskets of chips and salsa which we eat too much of everything was pretty good but the margaritas were really good i always try the house first time i go someplace since i think it is a good judge of how good a place is and theirs did not disappoint i think they should advertise them more because they are so good very fresh tasting next time we go back to az we will definitely visit again
__label__0 food was decent not too sure how this place is getting such rave reviews though probably the most expensive mexican place of its style 25 for a burro two tostadas and two minitacos seriously also no free refills or chipssalsa are we going back no
__label__1 i just got back from an arizona spring training vacation and one of the highlights was definitely the desert botanical gardens we came really close to skipping on a visit altogether because it was 500pm but decided to give it a shotit was worth it i was a little disappointed that the butterfly pavillion had closed for the day at 500pm and several walking areas were being used for weddingsreceptions who could blame these people but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife we managed to get in for free not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though which totally made the park that much more fun i am not sure i would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if id had to pay 5 to get in the little desert ratsqirrels and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows i felt like a little kid oohing and ahing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers and have to give this place the ultimate rating if youre ever in arizona please give this place a try its very well put together and a beautiful site to see
__label__1 love this place great staff friendly fun and knowledgable the food is always good
__label__0 us airways used to be right up there wcontinental now theyre down there i didnt even mind the fact that they started charging for their food but now theyre going overboard i didnt want to bring a heavy jacket wme to cabo so i wore a light jacket and i figured the standard blanket they give you during the flight would suffice i noticed there werent any blankets on board and when i asked a flight attendant for one he said yea for 7 i almost started laughing cause i thought he was trying to crack a joke he wasnt introducing us airways nap pack comes wcrappy blanket ear plugs inflatable neck rest for only 7 use the money you were previously going to use to purchase your online crappy meal for your standard necessities so i decline and they must crank the ac up ridiculously to tempt you to purchase their stupid nappy pack cause the tip of my nose was cold and i just couldnt sleep at all during my flight w hile i was trying cover every surface of my body wmy stretched out light jacket and you also suck cause you run out of your purchased mealswho doesnt pack enough for the flight you suck at even saving money for yourselves
__label__0 i dont like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice the ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross the ingredients are not fresh but rather canned also gross the chicken wings were not that great either the atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen tvs on the wall i will not be going back to this place so hopefully they get better soon since barros pizza is going in the area soon
__label__0 let me say this the bar at hannys is one of the best looking bars in phoenix this squareshaped sparkly thing gets an a on the presentation and they make some great cocktails the rest of the place not so much i agree with everyone else hannys has a great concept for a place they left the skeleton of an old department store intact complete with a completely unusable second story but the results arent spectacular the restaurant looks great inside like it should be a real classy establishment so why are they serving pizzas here the pies are decent yeah but really shouldnt we be getting steak here prime rib a nice grouper fillet perhaps with such a nice space and a primo location right in the heart of downtown id think hannys could step it up in the food department its like this place is confused about who it wants to be a neighborhood fare spot or a classy dining destination
__label__1 went to a party where they had stacys cater it so good it was the bbq beef bbq pork and bbq chicken all of them were fantastic but i enjoyed the pork best which is odd bc i am not typically a fan of pork anyhow it was all perfectly moist well seasoned and was a big hit at the party i would order from them for catering and i need to stop into the actual restaurant sometime to try the other items on the menu
__label__1 so as our last restaurant in phoenix i decided to visit green due to its great reviews and popularly i got the kung po with mock beef which was only 7 which is super cheap and really good the restaurant is hidden in like a little corner so its a little hard to find but the interior is nice and beautiful as a tip just remember that you seat yourself and you have to get the menus at the counter took us a while to realized that overall super cheap really good and nice place
__label__1 the harkins camelview 5 gives arizonans the unique opportunity to see movies that are normally reserved for screens in ny and ca without this theater there would be very little chance to see independent or foreign films in phoenix i give a lot of credit to dan harkins for keeping this theater open he certainly cant make much money at this location its financially impractical to keep such a small theater operating on such prime real estate this just shows dan harkins commitment to sharing great films with the people of az thanks dan
__label__1 impossibly good italian deli in the middle of the desert huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread youve ever had outside of ny as someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period i feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak holyshit easily the most decadent flavorful cheesesteak ive had in a very long time and i live 15 minutes outside of philly im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off ask for yours on the soft roll i should also mention the sausage peppers onion sandwich which was really good i suspect they make their own sausage which elevates them to superstar status in my book the chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well i dont do cold subs but the ones i saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty perhaps i will try their pizza next time im in town
__label__1 i order the same thing at every vietnamese restaurant rice vermicelli bun with grilled pork and egg roll and spring rolls this order does not change ever they do the pork here more like a pork patty or meatloaf if you will in vietnamese cuisine there are two different ways to do it the other being grilled slices of pork i dont know which i prefer as they are very very different you get a large amount of noodles very fresh vegetables and a generous portion of meat the sauce is tasty and everything seems very high quality spring rolls are good as is the peanut sauce they serve them with the service could be worse but not much its pretty horrendous atmosphere is typical of a vietnamese restaurant total dive
__label__1 baffled by the unfavorable reviews here easily one of the best burgers ive ever had is the zinburger truffle fries are also delicious always have good service here and leave very satisfied atmosphere is slightly upscale i suppose but not snobby as some complain you can wear shorts and a tshirt and feel right at home here
__label__1 blue saguaro has been doing the same menu of breakfast sandwiches seriously delicious toasted sourdough drenched in salty butter egg over medium crispy bacon and melty american but not kraft cheese and lunch sandwiches salads for over 10 years theres a reason that it hasnt really changed it works the lunch menu has specialty vs regular sandwiches most of the specialty are loaded up with sandwich fixings youre not going to get in a chain shop cream cheese sprouts avocado that wasnt spread on thinner than mustard the bread is bakery quality and theres a decent selection the ambience is non existent but when youre grabbing lunch on the run it really doesnt matter they are super fast but that may be because i always tip a buck
__label__1 luckily i didnt have to travel far to make my connecting flight and for this i thank you phoenix my brief layover was pleasant as the employees were kind and the flight was on time hopefully next time i can grace phoenix with my presence for a little while longer
__label__1 oh yeah coming to scottsdale i have used redseven in tempe and mesa and excited to know that they are coming to scottsdale i work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in scottsdale that i continue to brag to them about redsevens super quick service getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work oh and they talk to you so you can understand not computer talk cant wait for scottsdale
__label__0 my experience was on a random saturday afternoon and i think that might skew my opinion a bit during my visit we were the only guests dining there was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees the atmosphere is mellow and i can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings the prices were a bit high for what we ate i had a pita sandwich and it was just under 10 the lunch prices are a bit steep the food was okay but nothing id go back time and time again for
__label__0 i only ask for two things when im flying to land safely and to not fear planes while on them us airways only delivered on one of those and im still undecided on the first one took a flight late from phx to sfo two hours isnt too bad unless of course it was the longest two hours of your life and you could hear people in the cabin praying for their lives i understand that turbulence is normal but i would rather you cancel another flight because it is too dangerous to fly then to put passengers through the scariest flight of their lives oh and when you finally do land and are thanking your maker that you are in fact still alive its probably best that you dont have to overhear the pilots saying wow that was scary im surprised we landed alright morons they should pay for the trauma ill have for the rest of my life
__label__1 obligatory stop for a drinkdodey is here so that is always good
__label__1 friendly staff and clean office from what i have seen somewhat frequent turnover with the drs ive had right now i have dr susman shes concise to the point compassionate easy to understand oral surgeon dr lillien does his job well i got my wisdom teeth out without complications or infections later healed up pretty well scheduled out pretty far so difficult to get an appointment in if you have specific avail abilities certain staff could use more training on procedure and techniques to expedite the process and minimize xray radiation time julie is doing a breast cancer walk so donate personal check and get teeth whitening kit for 99 dollars about staff kendall is very friendly and professional noreen seems like she could use more training quite a few xray retakes with bite tabs but she was friendly overall the process took a bit longer than i anticipated suggestions train the staff thoroughly with technique and procedure so it can speed up customer service especially with bite tab as well as the other kind the red circular one customers like to minimize their radiation exposure time clean office and helpful reception staff dr susman was to the point and very clear about wahts going on and what to do next downfall scheduling can be somewhat difficult if ppl have specific avail abilities but in general reception staff is very helpful
__label__1 i lovelovelove green the atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better the people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful there are far too few vegetarian restaurants in phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support
__label__1 been there many times with many friends not fancy food but decent fresh local organic at a good price with none of the pretentions that one would associate with the whole organicgreen mocvement in dining that being said the food only gets 4 stars based on the price plus the 5 star browniesfood is above average but not by much the atmosphere and price are what i enjoy most
__label__1 loved the burgers and the onion rings were fabulous this place is a must visi if you are in the phoenix area anytime soon
__label__1 it was nice but not a great experience the music was very loud the waitress was very helpful and knew the menu and the wines and made some good recommendations love the newton chard we split a salad and a pizza the watermelon salad was an incredible medley of complex flavors the red chili giving the watermelon avocado and goat cheese some kick to offset the sweetness very interesting we got the funghi trifolati pizza and it was just ok after the first wonderful taste of mushrooms it was all very bland with nothing to make it stand out i think next time i would try sitting on the patio as that looked very inviting and relaxing
__label__1 no chip manicure no drilling no filing no damage no dry time we offer over 100 colors form opi shellac gelish experienced tech professional service and satisfaction guaranteed
__label__1 always treat me well very honest
__label__1 quick friendly awesome
__label__1 wouldnt you agree that a key part of enjoying the dining experience in part depends upon the company you are dining with having said that the times i have dined at abuelos have been with my fellow coworkers all female and yes we all get along needless to say we had totally fun memorable experiences filled with great conversations great food and good prices their corn chips are fresh and lite their salsa comes in different levels of heat i usually request the hot salsa im partial to their chicken enchilada portions are just right one is plenty for me usually served with rice in all fairness believe i need to sample other dishes before i could rate it any higher found another great restaurant in chandler az top3 reasons why1 great tasting dish 2 good value 3 atmosphere location service ambience
__label__1 we were staying at a local hotel and used online ordering to feed our crew the ordering went smoothly and the pleasant surprise was the food arrived early and warm we ordered two of their usual pizzas and one of our custom orders could have had a few more toppings on one of them but overall nice value and timely service with warm food we looked for the specials online and save a few dollars worth the time to do so would order again
__label__1 service is good the newer waitors tend to forget youre there food is delicious never gotten food poisoning cheesecake is magnificent the best kind is the godiva expensive bit worth it
__label__1 recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was dollar taco night a chicos that is fine if you have any idea of where it is turns out i had been by there more then a few times when i went to the safeway and subway at 7th st and mcdowell its a little place in a very small strip center its very much a neighborhood place clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside thats about all i can say about the setting i was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos the tacos arent to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than i would have expected that is all i had but from what i saw of the meals around me hey looked pretty good as a whole i will go back to chicos it definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to i went there after a very long day so that is saying something just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me i needed it
__label__1 i was also roped in with a flier on my door and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies salad and drink with a pizza order upon delivery i was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread no purchase necessary needless to say this has become a goto pizza option for me 4 stars for food taste and quality an extra for great service and good deals salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza pizza is particularly good cookies are awesome cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese their sauce is really tasty tastes fresh and not too sweet delivery is free and on time the longest time ive been quoted for a pizza at 700 on a saturday was 45 minutes and they got there in 23 minutes i wasnt timing them but i did notice how quick they got there they have a hotnready special thats only a dollar more than little sleazers and ten times better and if you dont think its good you get your money back so really you should just try it okay okay
__label__1 this is the very first time i have ever been in herethis location anyway the first one was in downtown seattle yes i came with my girlfriend both timesbut it is a cool place for men as well samples of colonge creams lotions and anything else you have ever wanted to try they will even give you samples of things to take home they will make you a sample of anything you would like to try it can be challange to get inside the scottsdale mall at times but on this day it was not too badduring the week and early in the day it is a cool placewith lots to see and try loads of people wanting to help you as well
__label__1 just came from there as part of my trip down the apache trail my 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back the town is really cute with tons of photo ops we picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge we did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it for those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap relaxthe kids love it this 40 something mom loved it its free to just walk around but definitely do the mystery shack weird and fun i actually got dizzy in it
__label__1 we live in the neighborhood so were excited to see a new place with a huge range of beers open up the decorations are a bit sparse but we like to sit on the patio or the conversation areas near the bar which are perfect this time of year yucca chips are personal favorites as is the gnocchi bolognese burger wasnt bad but a burger is just a burger theyre still adjusting their menu it seems which i expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in i really love their commitment to craft beer especially arizona beers 5 pitchers of az beer before 500 is not only quite a tasty offering but appeals to my love of all things local give ohso a try
__label__1 one of the better malls on the west side what am i saying the only mall on the west side good line up of the same old shops spencers petpad sears macys kitchen store but also the addition of dicks sporting goods and forever 21 they have a good food court starbucks movie theater and a chevys this was also the site of the sniper hijack of an armored car november 28 1994 as seen on city confindetial was a great episode worth watching but its not an unsafe mall like some of the malls west of i17
__label__1 just go eat here get the cheese curds i think they may be developing cca cheese curd anonymous soon but until it becomes a diagnosable disease i will continue to indulge oh yah the pine steak is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies oh oh oh the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in phoenix just do yourself a favor and go check this place out and try the home made ginger ale tonic or lemonade by them selves or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits
__label__1 coming into the phoenix area for a family party we stopped off at los sombreros for some margaritas and mexican on an otherwise cooler night in the valley of the sun i was told they are very picky about reservations and if your party isnt complete no table so our 6pm reservation was now in jeopardy because the last two of us me and my fiance were running late due to issues on the ramp at sky harbor airport obviously out of our control but they still didnt want to seat us additionally i overhead on the way to the place that they would only try to do their best to accommodate our party making it sound like they were booked up solid until closingtypical scottsdale always trying to look more happening and hot than it really is moving on we somehow lucked out go figure and had a table no problem so all the stress caused by the hostess was unnecessary and in my opinion pretty unprofessional especially since the restaurant was empty by 8pm again typical scottsdale the menu was brief and i almost had to double check i wasnt looking at an appetizer most of the items are typical mexican staples with a bit of a southwestern american twist to them making the food a hit or miss if you ask me some items were good some were not but thats really anywhere i suppose the one thing that stood out for me was the guac i will say this was flat out delicious but guac is pretty had to screw up the margaritas in my opinion reminded me of something youd get more at chilis a little too sweet for my liking but definitely drinkable the fundidto appetizer we ordered left the table empty twice and well im not really one to combine seafood and cheese this blend seemed to have a harmony with others and id recommend it to a first timer 1 if you request to add spinach finally moving on to the entrees different contraptions from the kitchen filled our table with vibrant colors assortments and sizes i myself ordered what i was told is sort of the house specialty call it carnitas mixed in a chipotle sauce with veggies type of deal while it was tasteful and was more than enough to get the job done for me the flavor of the pork wasnt really there at all i browsed over a couple other reviews and noted the same complaint but hey thats what hot sauce is for i guess overall its an alternative to the chains hoarding scottsdale road
__label__0 i dont know whats up with eddie i always found him to be pleasant and really taking care of the customers however on the 17th of november we had a birthday party of 19 people and they gave us one waitress we sat down at 700 pm and our main course came at 915 no real big deal but one person cant handle a table of 19 and we were having fun so one of the guests had ordered the 1200 burger along with a salad and told the waitress no mayo because he cant stand it at all the burger comes out and it has mayo on it and he tells the waitress she was not at fault and had written it down clearly he asked for a new one and she comes back and says eddie cooked the hamburger and refused to cook a new one but would make him a new bun he didnt want that because he hates mayo that much so there was no problem taking it off the tab but eddie would not make a new one lol whats up eddie i dont understand at all you take it off the bill because you screwed up but refuse to make another burger that you would have been paid for then you end up looking like a fool in front of the other eighteen people my daughter has even taken one of your classes and said what a great guy you are really really bad pr that night and the next birthday party wont be at eddies house great time that night but the ending leaves a very bad taste in 19 peoples mouth
__label__1 im not a huge sushi person i know i know but i ordered the tuna with lotus chips and it was very yummy the server was friendly and the chefs were efficient the atmosphere is dark and modern though a bit squashed and overwhelming
__label__0 after hearing a lot about all of the mbfgrs that are around the valley i finally got a chance to go recently as part of a family gathering which was a planning fiasco and logistical nightmare but i digress this location was well lets just say it wasnt crowded and it showed in the service very nice and attentive they were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people then ballooned to 12 people then 13 unfortunately one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables attached to our eight person round table i hate this its just awkward for at least half the people and then the people that get stuck at the junctionsucks we ordered some apps though the only one i tried was the saganaki it was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm for a meal i ordered a gyro pita now i understand that this is a full greek restaurant and maybe i shouldnt have gone with a gyro but thats what i was in the mood for and being a basic greek food shouldnt be hard to make a good one right well apparently not ive probably gotten gyros at ten places around town and this was definitely the worst one ive had the pita wasnt particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough the tzatziki was fine but thought it was a little weird to be on the side the service was good and patient but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together knocks them down a little bit though not as much as the not good gyro probably closed to a 25 but rounded down to 2
__label__1 i have been attending az combat for the past 9 years and the instructors are fantastic they teach kickboxing juijitsu and mma classes az combat was one of the very first mma gyms in arizona and have a great reputation as one of the top 10 training gyms in the nation my daughter has also been at this school for the same amount of time and has taken advantage of many of the classes they offer including their boot camp i would highly recommend this gym for beginners and the advanced looking to break into the mma circle they have produced some of the top named fighters in arizona
__label__0 i hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible i use to dine at this restaurant often with my family the more we go service decreased our water cups never get filled the very last time i was there i found a gnat in my pho although i have eaten about 50 of the medicore pho they asked if i wanted another bowl i said no i was there on my lunch break no time to wait for another bowl i got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise there was no discount or any sort of accommodation i am disappointed with them and will not be back
__label__1 i ordered the peanut panang chicken i rqstd to the waitress that i wanted extra bell pepper when it came it had no bell peppers at all i actually didnt realize this until about 5 mins into eating it could not find our waitress i waited about 7 mins finally i had to get up search for her i found another waiter told him my problem he took my dish but then came back to tell me that they are all out of green bell peppers would i like red bell peppers i said yes of course this whole experience has put a sour taste in my mouth about this place which is next door to the mediocre good egg on central i like wild thaiger on central much better instead
__label__0 since this was a little local spot i always passed i decided to give it a try one day the décor is so beyond needing an update it needs a complete makeover if you had mr ramsey visit he would say oh godwhat were you thinking the location is great and i think that the restaurant has potential to do better than it is the prices were about average in comparison to other breakfast restaurants in the area and the menu had a wide selection of breakfast goodies the food was extremely averagei would have to compare it to the quality and creativity of dennys nothing special and for 3000 for breakfast for twoi would not go back there are so many great restaurants in the area and i like to support local business but this place just needs to start from scratch to make it great
__label__0 zero stars i traveled from stl to sfo a few weeks ago with a layover in phx i have a couple complaints one i was checking 2 pieces of luggage in stl one ended up being 14lbs over weight it was a cooler with food i bring home each year from my dad i was charged an additional 90 on top of the 35 initially for the cooler to ship including the 25 for my first bag so 150 total this is an outrageous additional charge i thought overweight bags were charged an additional 25 like other airlines ive had to pay at but 120 to ship one bag is just insane and a set price for overweight bags is not listed on your website on top of that i paid 250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were 400 total 100 more than my round trip ticket to fly i couldnt believe that on another note the woman agent helping me at stl was the most rude customer service agent ive ever dealt with anywhere she was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldnt allow her to fly she raised he voice at me and called me a very inhumane person for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight seriously making me cry i fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem including on the first leg of my trip when i bought the round trip dog ticket in sfo this woman namecalling was totally inappropriate people in line beside me were astonished since i had my round trip dog ticket purchased already and she was sick of fighting with me over it she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldnt let me on the flight and of course the gate person did between the dog crate episode and the bags i have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees im very disappointed to not be able to fly us air anymore since i never had problems with them in the past it was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation i have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline
__label__1 for quick fast food this is my choice i usually call ahead and get take out dont expect super friendly but its just take out not clear table service even if you stay i always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but i will say im not a fan of the pungent dressing i get the chile sauce instead vietnamese rolls and its not so unhealthy now my friends that usually nosh with me hate the foods they get they say it every time i suggest this place who knows since i havent really tried anything from my norm salad i cant say but for me its a strong 3
__label__1 i have been to the freddys location in gilbert several times and really enjoyed it so when i saw a freddys had opened in my hood i was excited my daughter and i went over for some dessert and they did not dissappoint the custard was smooth and creamy with lots of toppings to choose from i have not tried the burgers at this location yet but if they are anything like the other location they will be very tasty and dont forget to try the shoestring fries i usually like thicker fries but these are nice and crispy and delicious im so glad freddys took over this location
__label__1 man the chompie sliders is the bomb wish there were some in la man taste so good and flavor
__label__0 this place was the worst place to ever live i lived here from aug 2010 to may 2011 i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed the office always gave me the run around very rude you would think after the gun shoots assaults and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still arent fixed when we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied also the gym is huge but none of the equipment works living here was so gross nothing worked our neighbors are mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross i hated living here but the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe scottsdale springs 300 bucks over 10 months after moving out i called them up like wtf and they were so rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt we even gave a fowarding address and we never got a letter in the mail about any damages they claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull i really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company
__label__1 ive swung into echo a few times and havent ever had a bad cup of coffee the cappuccino is pretty solid and the zucchini bread i had for breakfast one day was a win if i recall correctly it came in a cute little box too for some reason ive never been able to feel relaxed and at home enough to chill and enjoy an afternoon or evening there not sure why but just havent
__label__1 great food the french dip is to die for great service clean and fancy especially for the area its located in def a hidden gem my husband and i both love going here and cant wait until next time
__label__1 the hole in the rock was pretty interesting but only for about 5 minutes its not a hike at all more of a walk on unpaved ground once youre up there the view is pretty cool but the crowds of people and rowdy kids and dogs detract from the magnificence and romance id think its a great place to take kids though because of how easy it is good thing its located in papago park so you can go and see the zoo or the gardens or hunts tomb while youre there if you go just to see the hole its kind of a waste of time
__label__1 love the wings
__label__1 was looking for something refreshing for a nightcap on a hot scottsdale night you will not be disappointed the sorbet was really tasty and refreshing
__label__0 this place is over priced and the service is horrible i went there with my feiends and the server was very rude and degrading
__label__1 changing hands is the perfect bookstore these types of places just dont seem to exist but changing hands has managed to survive allow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a barnes and noble or probably a borders but i dont go into that garbage store and cannot be sure with that said there are a few reasons to shop here first and most importantly they have well priced used books i believe most of their used books are 750 they are also all in pristine condition now 750 used isnt always that great for a paperback you can do better online quite often whats notable however is that their hardcovers are typically 750 as well this is a fantastic price and is hard to beat second the location of ch is perfect this is one of the best plazas out there wildflower trader joes macs jamba juiceyou cant go wrong third and finally changing hands is a local store and many good things come with that the staff is extremely friendly from what i can tell they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that the store also has a very welcoming feel to it once youre in you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is no not just the staffthe customers everyone is talkative friendly and just seems to be happy they are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores i have ever seen someone will ask the staff who wrote such and such the staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her who wrote such and such if he doesnt know someone else will probably pipe up its this type of thing that makes it a great store overall it just has a great atmosphere the only negative comment i can make about changing hands is how hippy it is theres a ton of books on spiritual techniques new age methods buddhism and whatever the hell else hippieshipsters think makes them look more cultured of course this just goes along with the tempe trader joes and book reading demographic so i cant blame them for meeting the inherent demand
__label__1 very clean store but i guess when youre paying about 300 more than you would anywhere else the place can afford it the people in the front are pretty friendly there is a lady in the deli she is pretty friendlytalkative there are people who mill around the store wearing name tags they are not friendly or polite i just cannot get over how expensive safeway is
__label__1 ive been to a few schlotzkys around the valley and this one is actually surprisingly one of the nicer ones its clean with plenty of space for even the largest working group lunch service comes quick and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great if youre one of the many people who work for a large company on the dunlap corporate freeway this is not a bad place to grab a bite before the second half of your work day one quick tip its kind of tough to find but its a stones throw north of dunlap on the frontage rd you have to go back and around a building to find it though
__label__1 tried this place for the first time tonight and was impressed with absolutely everything welllit building in a decent location in the arcadia area i drove here from the garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries along with one of the best slices of toast ive ever had all three of these foods were still crispy when i got home which almost never happens with fast food i wish i had gotten the girls name who took care of me she was cute as a button very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions ill be back here soon
__label__1 love the food
__label__1 its okay its nothing like san francisco food
__label__1 whyd the chicken cross the road to get to food truck fridays in downtown phoenix i know that all you business yelpers go out for lunch on fridays its basically a rule if you sit in an office a cubicle or behind a desk somewhere from monday through friday dont believe me check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work somewhere between how to comb your hair what you shouldnt wear and please dont come in smelling like nair youll find it while yelping about your friday lunch is purely optional i certainly hope you do during your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls ending up in the open air of food truck friday will kick off your weekend right its not just for burger king people its time to get it your way pick your favorite food from gourmet hot dogs with short leash or mexican with luncha libre smoothies and salads with mojo bowl to pies with mama toledos and creme brulee with torched goodness bring your friends and your favorite gal they can choose their own favorite too dont worry about bringing cash everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy this is your lunch hour kick back and forget about work while youre here if only for 45 minutes listen to the djs spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters fans and swamp coolers bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90s this is your downtown business yelpers its time to kick off those business casuals and make friday lunch your own
__label__1 edens grill has to be one of my favorite and newly discovered middle easternmediterranean restaurant in the phx metro located in a sleepy strip mall close to arties ace is eg my partner and i had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything we started off with the hummus followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate the vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades falafel rice veggie skewers and veggie patties 2 the vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious next time well pay the extra 5 and split one vegetarian plate instead of getting two the pita and hummus were fresh and delicious however i find egs hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus overall i would totally recommend eg to anyone with an itch for middle easternmediterranean food but be warned they arent open for lunch on the weekends yet
__label__1 hellllllllo golfers what a sexy course this is this ranks up there with some of the best courses ive ever played and the best desert course i have ever played yes its desert links style golf but youre in the desert so what do you expect its kind of a trek but itll be worth it from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave youll enjoy the service and scenery a real private club feel as mentioned earlier this is desert links golf no adjoining fairways and all the crap plays as pga desert lateral the fairways are pretty wide for the most part so you can spray the ball a bit but there is definitely some carry involved on some of the tee boxes hole 18 is a very hard core par 4 long carry on the approach to the green with a ton of water along the right side of the fairway and green this is the kind of hole that can ruin a good day on the course real quick dont be afraid to lay up oh and there are mens ratings for all the tee boxes id recommend higher handicappers play from the forward tees because this course could be really hard if youre a mediocre golfer maintenance was perfect even in september after baking in the arizona heat all summer the fairways were well manicured and not too hard nice rough but not too tall a slightly errant shot will be caught but you wont have to worry about searching for your ball for 5 minutes either the greens were also perfect nice and fast and true ok im done gushing about this course give it a shot you wont regret it
__label__1 tim is really a very friendly and honest guy he will tell you what you need or what can wait this place is worth going to it will save you tons of money
__label__1 i have liked every sub ive had there with the exception of one pretty good odds
__label__1 after driving down a teeny dimly lit road and coming across what looked like a medical office building in the 60s my husband and i found the amazing fuego bistro we had a perfect meal there amazing ambiance twinkly lights in the courtyard live musician great wine food was so unique and delicious id describe it as southernspanish fusion this meal was the highlight of our trip to phoenix if you live in phoenix you have no excuse to not come here i live in chicago and im sure ill be back
__label__1 id leave my scottsdale bubble for a few reasons and yes there are additional exceptions 1 nobuo at teeter house 2 fez 3 my friends in various parts of the valley and 4 mekong supermarket i consider myself to be a huge fan of asian cuisine chinese japanese filipino korean indian you name it ill eat it i have my healthy moments but i am a seasoned eater and i am not afraid of exploring the world through my palate mekong is the perfect place for me to massage my senses the aroma and sensations from the exotic product the stunning visual of a catfish being bopped on the head and then cut up and packaged the cheesy elevator music on the loudspeaker the delicious taste of a spring roll from the hot food bar this place has it all i usually come here for my asian condiments and live seafood want a live crab boom done want spicy mustard or sriracha in a large bottle for cheap its yours to me there is nothing like taking the 10 mile drive in traffic to mekong because i know i am going to get everything i want make the trek you wont regret it
__label__0 total bait and switch sales department will tell you one price over the phone then quote you another when you arrive happened to me personally 3 times i bought from scottsdale bmw one quote one price done deal buyer beware
__label__1 my sister took me here last week its crazy that i havent been yet right this is her regular go to place not much i can say after so many reviews here already the patio looked very nice i bet its the place to be when its cooler it was kind of empty in here but it was late afternoon my sis ordered us some drunken italian sodas they were made super strong though usually this would not detour me however i had my child with me and had to drive all the way back home after basically it tasted like straight vodka in a giant glass it was a bit much for me mid day and after adding sprite to it which i stole from my daughter i still couldnt drink it without feeling like id be a drunken mexican after i didnt understand this drink maybe someone can explain it to me my sis told me their sangria was good but i had no idea they made caipirinhas next time thats what i get no question the food we had the garlic lemon hummus it was really good the ingredients separately didnt have much taste to them but together it was really nice the pita bread was excellent the kid couldnt stop eating the hummus she got so full she barely touched her mac n cheese so we brought that home along w all the leftover hummus now on to the tejano burger we decided to split omg it was so delicous i couldnt put it down and we both regretted having split it w each other extra star just for that burger alone you best try it if you havent son
__label__1 still a great place to eat a little further from los tacos in aj home for me since los tacos closed i frequent here more often it is good i want to add that their green corn tamales are great their green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on yelps reviews i like it a lot too i plan to order more tamales for the holidays hurrah
__label__0 food was amazing but the service was horrible i would suggest to take out dont dine in i ordered the eggs benedict instead of canadian bacon they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette the two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire
__label__0 i will make this real easy for you just go to inandout burger if you dont want to feel gross and poor
__label__1 pretty good food the selection was great the service was a bit slow and i had to seat my family my self but overall it was ok all day every day 99 cent margaritas
__label__1 after talking to a number of bartenders in the area and doing some fairly extensive personal research i feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the phoenix area you should head to the jade bar at the sanctuary resort this is off the beaten path a bit and after a few miles down streets with no street lights it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains its worth the drive though i had two excellent cocktails the last word and a pendemums club and one enjoyable and informative conversation with jillian the bartender wish i could have made some of their mixology classes
__label__1 very typical mexican food nothing special
__label__0 normally have had great service food here but on fathers day nicole h was simply horrible rude slow nonhelpful etc just a total fail a different fooddeliverer brought out food and auctioned it off didnt know who got what and i asked for a refill on my empty water glass but he didnt bring it after 15 minutes and nicole didnt notice so i had to bring it up to her their bloody marys taste just like tomato juice with tobasco nothing special at all and for 12 shame the coq au vin was great why is there no contact usemail address on their website
__label__1 this is a real find and i mean find because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown glendale this small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine not many polish restaurants around the food is flavorful and fresh the soups are unique and tasty the stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stewthe owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing my only disappointment is the limited hours i work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week definitely worth the trip
__label__0 i live close but will stop eating there the service was slow my friend complanned about a order he had and they said ow next time tell them to make it different for you really then i ordered another simple california roll took forever the sushi is allright but the overall experience is worth driving somewhere else you lost me
__label__1 spinatos has great red sauce for the pasta but i prefer a more earthy pizza high school kids love it though this restaurant was a chilis before but they have remodeled and did a fabulous job the take out door is discrete and the bar area is large and comfortable food portions are quite big and they have a nice selection on the menu
__label__1 dropping down to three stars on a recent visit i saw two roaches on the main floor of the restaurant no one seemed to care so i got up and stepped on one i pointed out the other and one of the staff killed it but they didnt seem surprised i know that roaches are hard to control but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isnt a good thing also our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice they had some good staff in the past but i suspect the owner who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for the food is still decent and better than anything else ive found but im looking for alternatives
__label__1 i work next door and i love her she has done an excellent job of slim fitting my baggy shirts well she did ask me if i was gay but then hey given how animated i get about clothes i dont blame her for askin my so found this rather amusing and laughed her head off oh well getting back to my review i love nadya cuz she does a wonderful job each time she knows when the darts will give the slimming effect and when the sides are to be taken in its never too tight and never too lose and she always always delivers on time i have been here atleast 10 times trust me my metrosexuality wouldnt let me let me go back if it wasnt a five star service
__label__0 remember how i said that the trivia was the best thing about this place well they got rid of long time triva host dave who had been featured in the college times and was the best thing about the trivia without daves personality this place just doesnt cut it will never go here again bummer
__label__1 how could you write a bad review about a mountain great sight to see
__label__1 food is good to the tummy to me this is better than in and out burger place is spotless friendly service and wide selection
__label__1 when im looking for the more mature laid back version of lux i come to copper star coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting great neighborhood favorite
__label__0 i have literally never seen this place open and i live two blocks away
__label__0 wow not in a good way the sashimi was good because all they did was cut it but that was iteverything else made me wish i went real chinese not chinese making sushi culture theives ps snow crab is not the main ingredient to every roll
__label__1 oz is a great local bar and a nice change from the bumping charlies which dont get me wrong is still a good bar booker the bartender is the coolest and will bring you any of the toys on the back counter so long as he has time the cheap prices awesome juke box sorry korina we were probably the ones playing all the madonna and a chance of spotting stephanie annthe most fabulous drag queen around who really knows her vodkaare but a few of the reasons why i love this place its also walking distance from my bffs house
__label__1 im a big fan of their strawberry water and if im looking for a better lunch than what i have at home ill swing by and pick up a salad from here they have a good selection and its constantly expanding
__label__1 i love this place sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but damn those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good not to mention the ninja bowls good god get the sizzling ninja top that off with a fried egg and pineapple get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then drench that bowl with ninja sauce and sriracha which comes standard btw amazing dont waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did and for those wondering they dont serve pirates some will understand this fact also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at your face like ninja stars i joke they dont throw them but you may get some for free really though
__label__1 im married to a japanese and work for japanese company ive been to japan i dont know how many times and have eaten well there this is simply top class id even say special the style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure japanese to japanese with some very tasteful western inflections im not in phoenix often but this will be on my list every time i go if i have anything to say about it
__label__1 overall this place isnt so bad for a quick mexican food place its not like eating at a restaurant or anything like that the food portions are pretty great and sold at a fair price i really liked their salsa and i felt it was nice and flavorful id say this place is a small step up from filbertos the staff here however were really rude they seemed to want to rush everyone around
__label__0 i rather go to native or zipps we have had bad expierence after bad expierence here if you are craving wings this isnt the spot for you
__label__1 what can i say i love ajs especially the boulangerie or coffee bar jason is the best the pineapple ice tea with a slice of pineapple is delish with a yummy cheese croissant i admit i usually get something from the coffee bar and bistro more so than the actual grocery store oh and if you go check out the displaydecorations they are usually pretty cool
__label__1 missed the happy hour but the margaritas were not expensive waited for an outside table but had to wait inside because you are not permitted to wait outside with a drink in hand as an aside saw 2 arrests on mill ave after dinner becuse 2 guysgot caught drinking beer not so carefully disguised in brown bags well worth it on a beautiful nightgreat for people watching yes cornbread is good but the nachos with 3 types of salsa was better my entree was a chicken mushroom artichoke stack decent but not fabulous my wifes mushroom enchillada was better
__label__1 this is place is a weekly trip for us as my girlfriend loves the salmon and martinis they serve here we have been frequenting this place ever since we moved to the area versus the rare trips we would take for the awesome cream cheese chocolate cake made by caroline or the lunch caesar chicken sandwich here are my ratings of each dining point i consider when going here service 55 fast and very helpful even the chef will dig up custom stuff and cares what people think of the new entrees ambiance 45 the place used to be a home so its a little cramped but nice nonetheless not as comfy as some others like ticoz but we like it as it is small in seating ranges you cant get too loud so keep the rowdy folks to the applebees locales drinks ginger ale and the kiltlifter is nice as well as the blackwidow and black blue martinis recommended food fish 55 my girls favorites are the halibutswordfishmiso salmon with basmati rice she also loves the spinach and asparagus sandwiches 55 for roast chicken with green chili side of coleslaw or balsamic salad 45 chicken caesar is good but sometimes is hit and miss meatloaf 55 best i have ever had it is a beauty tacos 45 one time i had pork tacos they were the best ones i had tasted the next time they were ok then the last time they were great not sure why but still recommended cream cheese cake 55 made from local baker who used to do deserts for circa 1900 but now does it for them and urban bean to name a few steakchicken pork 35 i have tried each and every one here and while you wont be disappointed there isnt a wow factor like the meatloaf the sauces seem to not match or compliment the specific meat in my opinion i would love a bordelaise sauce or onions and mushrooms with the filet for example appetizers i am not a fan of the bruschetta but havent tried the rest i have heard the crab cakes are awesome but have yet to compare them to fezs awesome versions pricing is on par with sophies but less than christophers and more that ticoz i am fine with it as the food i order is totally worth it
__label__1 im from chicago so im picky with my pizzathis place does it right ny style i love the hole in the wall feel every customer that walked in was a regular which was a good sign i ordered the mozzarella sticks and a large monster pie sausage pepperoni bell peppers onion and cheese the mozzarella sticks took a little while to come out but they were cooked to perfection they also threw in a few garlic knots which was awesome the pizza was unbelievablei think the crumbled sausage really did it they have great deals like large pie 20 wings for 20 which i definitely will be taking advantage of during football games on sunday glad to have found a new place where i can also be a regular
__label__1 i would give this place 35 stars the service was excellent and the view of pheonix at sunset was nice i ate the wedge salad nothing special and the chorizo mac and cheese yummy the highlight for me was the pudding trio the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was smallwhich led me to savor every bite the other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints
__label__1 great food and drink the traditional margaritas are the best sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining the cheese enchilada that i had was one of the best ever
__label__1 ive eatin a lot of pizza and can say without worries that mama mias is the best ive had consistency value and great service sets them apart they also have the best take out wings in town
__label__1 i love sail inn getting past the 810 cover on weekends is the hard part but usually sail delivers 1 amazing local bands 2 laid back hippie hipsterarty folk vibe 2 cheap drinks love the little pitchers of beer budlite for 425 on certain nights phoenix has a pretty lame music scene but at least at sail inn you can always find decent live music and a fun crowd
__label__1 the culinary dropout you get the best of both worlds the food is off the hook its great the service these ladies and guys take care of your every need and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in phoenix entertaining you while you dinnecheck it outbluesman mike
__label__1 totally worth the drive from scottsdale the food is delicious and is not prepackaged such a nice change for a coffee joint support local business starbucks has nothing on lux other than a million locations
__label__1 so i am not usually in the tempe area but a friend told me about this place so i though i would go try it out i got a grande latte that was around 4 not a bad price but what made it worth it was that i guess this friday i went was a free shot friday so i got an extra espresso shot in my latte making it a triple for 4 bucksno that is a deal not sure if they always have the promotion on fridays but it sure did make my morning a little better their menu is very easy to read and give those no too educated in the was of coffee a good description of what each drink is and how it is made the had a ton of great looking pastries even though i didnt sample any cakes eclairs scones and i think even what looked like cheesecake the decor was very interesting an old fashion coffee house meets a gypsy vibe i think they have wifi too i saw a few people on there computers the service was a little slow i think felt like i was waiting for my drink for 10 minutes and the place was not really that busy this was probably because of the guy ahead of me when i walked in who had about 7 different modifications to his drink i have worked in a coffee place and those people are kind of annoying so i will let them slide on the time of service overall a great experience would have been 3 stars but when you get something for free in my book that is an automatically another star
__label__1 really because it doesnt get any better than this for what it is and for what its worth this place is truly unique a slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place this quaint spot serves up good tasty and satisfying food hot from the kitchen what is a pasty a pastys history can be associated with the tin miners in england the story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface supposedly the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the handles and when done discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines at the cornish pasty co i can first hand recommend the chicken pesto very good flavoring and filling or you can go with the more traditional route with beef potatoes and swede the sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well pros good food originality portions customer service coat hooks at the bar cons small interior
__label__1 theres a special little place in my heart designated specifically for jobot so im thrilled to be the 100th person to get to sing the praises of this adorable little coffee shopcreperieholeinthewall bundle of amazingness i came across jobot by accident about a year ago while looking for a late night wifi spot to do some studying it fit the bill perfectly minus the fact that it was extremely difficult to concentrate with the loud music coming from the lost leaf the interesting conversations that i couldnt help from overhearing and the endless amount of scrumptious plates that kept parading past me that said ive made several study trips to jobot since while i may not be as productive as i would be at some of those quieter little coffee shops where everyone has their nose in a book or a laptop i find that i always walk away a very happy camper every time their crepestacos are delicious all of them sometimes i feel as though the crepes are slightly undercooked but once i dig inside to discover the tantalizing flavors that lie within i tend to forget all about that the root beer pork remains one of my faves followed by a strawberrybanana concoction for dessert yum yum yum go here if you want good coffee the bumble bee is tasty good eats good conversation good atmosphere good prices good entertainment and free wifi at any and all hours they dont seem to close on weekends and if youre really feeling frisky head down a house or two for some nachobot gosh i love this place
__label__1 great thanksgiving meal i had a similar meal at busters on the lake for cheaper last year but that doesnt take away from the good spinach and sweet potatoes good service good bread good view
__label__1 i have had the opportunity to watch games at the staples center and honda center in los angeles and anaheim both are great arenas and are very fan friendly jobingcom is totally different and thats not a bad thing i really enjoy the arena is in the same complex with restaurants and movie theater great place to hang out before and after the game parking is great i actually had a parking pass and did not use it i just parked at the west gate parking lot the arena was very easy to acess and we had a great time we will be coming back many more times
__label__1 total wine totally takes a crap on bev mo this store has everything the employees are also very knowledgeable the other day we went in and my husband insisted i try red wine instead of sticking to my usual riesling i dont like change so we asked one of the employees and he asked me a few questions then suggested a bottle of malbec the malbec tasted amazing i was so happy for those of you who dont know its not only wine you can find everything else total wine has helped us stock our bar and entertain our guests also dont forget to chill your bottles before you leave
__label__0 so clearly the musicians make the night our night was not so hot half of the bad that we caught wasnt worthy of stage time the other half was the horn players were exceptional the keyboardist wasnt ill stick to the facility the rhythm room is a phoenix classic on the music scene or so im told this was evident when paul reed showed up with his horn and just joined the band on stage that was cool and made you feel like you were in the right place beyond that im cant really claim that this place is worth the time well have to try it again to confirm yet my urge to do so isnt high right now the neighborhood is questionable the entrance is not obvious the bar and the service are not inviting the music area of the building is excellent you sit very close to the band the one thing they need to fix within that is two sets of band doors would allow for a much faster setupteardown between bands we waited for an hour between bands the rhythm room is missing an opportunity here they need a comedian or something the fill the gap some fresh eyes on how this place is run could really make some simple improvements just because its a known classic doesnt mean that it cant change for the better the one thing they have right is that the sound is good and if theyre getting good bands then it makes for a great night the annoyances only become obvious when you have an hour to descern them between bands the musicians interaction with the crowd before and after shows is really cool this makes everyone involved feel like theyre in the scene
__label__1 im still a big fan of the light rail sure i cant use it every day but its about the only thing that will get me to head to downtown for a night out its perfect for pub crawls you can gather a huge group keep everyone more or less together and make frequent stops the extended hours mean more time for drinking the trains have stayed clean they run when they are supposed to and ive never had a problem the people watching is awesome as well each stop is a mystery grab bag of the teeming masses of people here in town i just wish it had a wider range id use it every day if i could
__label__0 i had eaten breakfast twice at the chandler chompies and loved it so i wanted my husband to try them however we went to the tempe location instead much older restaurant pretty worn and it took some time for me not to be grossed out by the nasty overall smell of the place my breakfast wasnt half as good this time and my husband didnt like his either just boring and not repeatable hoping hell give me another shot and well make the drive out to chandler next time
__label__1 food great service excellent i had the frank sinatra calzone you choose 3 items for the fillingi suggest what i had sausage pepperoni and meatball it was just like being back in new york loaded with ricotta toothey dont skimp here the server was great toodidnt catch his name but hes a burly bald headed guy with a beard very friendly polite attentive cool to look in the kitchen and see the pizzas being hand tossedwonder if the cook thinks i was looking at himwell i actually was but only because he really got into tossing the pizzas and was entertaining to watch go there eat everything tip big
__label__1 the vig uptown has its hits and misses but the hits definitely outnumber the misses first of all the building and atmosphere is awesome i think it used to be a bank of america they really outdid themselves with the renovations and decor the drinks while pricey are really good i had the basilginstrawberry drink and it was deeeelishhhh my husband had a tasty ipa he has never had before service was good our server seemed to have a zillion tables and still was attentive and pleasant when it comes to food my husband and i had different experiences he had the vigazz burger which he thought was outstanding it is now tied with 2 other burgers for his favorite burgers of all time vegetarian entrees are limited to a couple salads and a veggie sandwich i had the veggie sandwich which was decent but i wasnt impressed although the grilled veggies were tasty the sandwich was dry overall the foccacia was a little too doughy and the caramelized onions were more raw than caramelized the french fries were good but the barbeque seasoning on them annoyed me slightly i think next time i will ask if i can order a grilled cheese off the kids menu with a side of their yummy spicy mayo talking about kids menu that was another miss having a stepson myself i appreciate hip establishments that are still kid friendly however there was a very obnoxious group of kids and parents that looked like they just came from the kids soccer game the kids dominated the bocce court and were loud rude and obnoxious the parents were enjoying their cocktails and ignored their kids behavior it kind of ruined the mood for us i wish they would have just gone to peter piper like most kids teams do after a game we do really want to return maybe for happy hour or brunch i want to try their bloody marys and the amber scramble we might even take our kid but dont worry he will be well supervised
__label__0 took the family to the recent opening of this local logans roadhouse to check it out and maybe find a new local gem initial impressions were that logans is an imitation of one of my favorite family steakhouses texas roadhouse we go there every chance we can and have never been disappointed in the quality of food or service anyway back to logans atmosphere was okay again a wannabe texas roadhouse but not quite right service was fine but once the food came that sealed the deal very disappointing not that it was bad or anything but the quality of the steaks just wasnt anywhere close to what you get at texas roadhouse and when the prices are about the same well theres just no sense wasting time or money here you might think im being rough but when all 3 of my kids ages 711 say that they like texas better thats gotta say something they usually never say anything bad they usually just eat whats in front of them so by now you can obviously guess that i dont recommend logans i really only have one more thing to add dont mess with texas
__label__1 i have never had bbq in the south texas or anywhere outside of california except bobby q but of all the places ive tried bobby q is my current favorite bbq place ever i found this place on yelp and came here while on a trip to arizona the place was pretty crowded but we only waited about 1520 minutes we ordered babyback ribs st louis ribs corn and maccheese they also give you delicious amazing cornbread everything was excellent the st louis ribs were the best ribs i have ever had they were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the outside with dark grill marks their bbq sauce was equally awesome and the kind i like a bit more on the sweeter side less on the vinegary side the babyback ribs were also tasty but not as flavorful and less meat of course than the st louis ones the sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs i dont know if i will ever be in phoenix again but this place is a mustreturn if i ever am oh and at the end of the meal they gave us complimentary piping hot fresh cinnamon donuts that doublewon me over i want bobby q right now
__label__0 great in its day now leaves a lot to be desired deserves credit as a phoenix landmark chinese restaurant this restaurant has been here for 38 years ive been going here off and on for 35 years i go here more for sentimental reasons and not so much for the food the interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago the rest of the decorations have been torn out i believe the decor is modeled after the forbidden palace in beijing see the vaultoftheheavens style crenelations in the ceiling i have this restaurant in its former self to thank for this back in its day this restaurant was really great and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study chinese and then later go live over there for some years sadly the food here is not all that good the fryer oil they use here is pretty old the fried rice arrives looking almost black from the fryer oil too much soy sauce instead of a rich golden brown and tastes overcooked somehow the eggrolls are just ok definitely not fresh a lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu for example the special chinese cakes served on a plate topped with a delicious gravylike brown sauce and shallots probably some form of cantonese food all of this is gone and replaced by very plain fare and not very good at that if you like salty greasy plaintasting yet somehow edible chinese food not far from the 1perscoop variety then go here golden phoenixs heyday as a great restaurant is longgone let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good now passed on
__label__1 i love this place great place to grab a quick smoothie or stay to hang out just let them know if youre in a hurry ps the phone number is area code 480 not 490
__label__1 i absolutely love the food here the service is good the food is excellent and as far as the price goesi cant complain this is one of favorite places to eat
__label__0 i was really excited about this event maybe my expectations were too high because i was really underwhelmed very little shade ran out of water by the time i got there at 1pm other obligations 20 of the vendors were out of food and by the time i ate my way through some everyone else was already out 60 bucks for that i dont think so and when i mentioned it to the person in charge he was patronizing invalidating and kept telling me how happy the chefs were well im your consumer big guy sorry devoured wish it could have been better what food i did try was pretty good
__label__0 i had received an email from a student retention telling me that i still owe money for the time that i had taken classes two weeks although these fools canceled my financial aid i will sue this school if they even attempt to collect money from me and i have withdrawn from the classes on the right time but this rep told me that the withdrawal period was jan 11
__label__1 i like pei wei its good when i want something fast but the main reason for my review on here today was to say how amazing the manager was at this location i came in at lunch and it was very busy there was a line to the door there were some arguments about someone stealing a seat unhappy customer complaining because a seat was saved and they had waited in line wanted to be comped because of it so dumb if you ask me i mean just deal with it people its busy but the manager dealt with it so professionally and when i was next in line he did not act rushed he was very helpful and told me that if i did not like what i ordered to just tell him and he would get me something new i work in the restaurant business a much higher priced place and this manager was awesome good job man
__label__1 its about time i write a review for kona grill after all ive been here more times than i can count and 2 of these times occurred this week alone kona grill is a chain which makes me want to give them only 3 stars but considering their food is quality they offer a fun atmosphere and their service is decent im giving 4 stars instead as many of the reviews before mine say happy hour at kona is great from 3 7 they offer 12 off a small menu of appetizers sushi rolls pizzas and drinks they also have a reverse happy hour from 10pm on i think i cant speak for the pizzas ive never tried them but the potsticker appetizer is great and so is the sushi if im not concerned about happy hour prices ive often ordered other menu items such as seaweed salad edamame nigiri and the seabass entree too ive never been disappointed i usually do not choose kona as a destination but if im in the area at the mall or someone else chooses it im happy going to kona every now and then its good for what it is take it or leave it
__label__1 best time to work out at this gym is in the early morning went in the afternoon a few times and its usually packed this place has everything i need to work out threadmill free weights machines basketball court swimming pool and sauna rarely do i see any of the machines out of order broken although the mens sauna bench was broken for maybe 23 months before they finally fixed it
__label__1 i would echo many of the positive things others have mentioned about phoenix city grille everything i had here was just downright good ribs were mouthwatering fall off the bone marinated fresh each morning and not overcoated perfect really didnt even need the sauce they had such flavor already black bean soup was nice and the chopped salad was real good too with a nice peanut dressing nice wine list with plenty of affordable bytheglass options and the server we had was nice too my companion and i stumbled in after a hike to piestewa peak and were definitely underdressed but everyone was nice about it and they clearly wanted out business and valued us as customers if i lived in this area of phoenix this would be in my rotation for sure
__label__1 in addition to the nice atmosphere on the patio they serve a very nice brunch menu and the 2 bloody marys are a buy downside parking validation is only a discount not a freebie depending on when you go the service can be slow during a recent happy hour the barmaid herself was left to tend to all bar patrons and the patio
__label__1 new to the scottsdale area ive been searching for a nail salon for a few weeks i stumbled upon this place and was very happy although its in a weird strip mall its really relaxing inside my gel manicure was perfect and the shoulder massage was a nice added extra totally recommend
__label__1 just the facts re full dinner experience ambiance thinking about redecorating the house to look just like trader vics unbelievable service perfectly charming informative and attentive drinks i dont drink so read every other review for a review of drinks appetizer beef chocho amazingly tender it melts in your mouth great flavor dinner trader vics calcutta curries good better when you mix in the variety of garnishes fun to play around with the flavors dinner 2 chinese bbq flat iron steak amazing crispy onions mashed potatoes and tenderflavorful steak will make you close your eyes and wish it would never end dessert dont know the name vanilla icecream covered in coconut on a bed of chocolate sauce simple beautiful and tasty overall experience the best darn dinner experience ive ever had
__label__1 45 stars ive eaten at liberty market a few times already but this morning marked my first breakfast and what a fantastic meal it was of pancakes 3 in a stack 65 httpwwwyelpcombizphotos3n9u549zse8upmwkzajaqselectxg8u6fz2e8hu0xq3hf7czgxg8u6fz2e8hu0xq3hf7czg w added topping of marketmade granola 1 a side of grilled flattened meatballs 35 httpwwwyelpcombizphotos3n9u549zse8upmwkzajaqselectmmwkpmltbkcwnnlraitgwmmwkpmltbkcwnnlraitgw and a doubleshot of espresso 2 httpwwwyelpcombizphotos3n9u549zse8upmwkzajaqselectm1wrcux3oouhhrynl8kjqgm1wrcux3oouhhrynl8kjqg service was in fine form i couldnt have the marketmade maple syrup blend nor any of the housewhipped cream blueberry compote raspberry and apricot jams or any of the flavored syrups used at the coffee counter my server patiently checked for those items we were unsure about and when i asked for chocolate chips i was instead offered a chocolate syrup made from scratch composed of chocolate sugar and coco oil good stuff this syrup would be excellent on ice cream sundaes too fyi i didnt really need anything extra to add to the pancakes and meatballs the two paired well ive mentioned this once before but i think its such a great thing to yelp about again buy an espresso or any of their specialty coffees and you can have unlimited cups of regular coffee during your meal not like i needed more caffeine after the doubleshot but i did have some of the houseblend coffee after 15 pancakes the meatballs watch out theyre very greasy and caffeine ill be good to go for a few hours despite only having four hours of sleep im hoping anyway ps despite tipping more than 20 at the cashier upon ordering i thought bruce the server who took care of me at my table deserved a couple more bananas for not displaying annoyance at my staying here so long one more reason why i love liberty market so much addendum after getting directions from bruce as to the quickest way to 101 n he asked me if i wanted a cup of coffee to go gratis have i told you how much i love liberty market helpful hint free wifi can be accessed by entering the code printed at the bottom of your receipt
__label__0 i bought a new mountain bike from them in dec 2011 the buying experience was great my salesperson was very knowledgeable and they had the bike built in a couple of hours my problem was the included 90 day tuneup they didnt do any of the work that needed to be done and gave the bike back to me with my brakes rubbing gears not shifting correctly and wheels that needed to be trued after spending thousands of dollars on my bike and accessories i expected more they only give one tuneup at landis less then many of their competitors so i wish things would have been done correctly i will be bringing my bike to another shop for service in the future
__label__1 was here for a kyot winedownwednesday event a couple of years ago the bar area was packed stood around waiting for a table to open up very uncomfortable as the area is pretty small i remember trying the new england clam chowder tasty but it had too much potatoes and not enough clams had something else but cant recall which and the current menu online reflects a few changes i do recall thinking i would like to come back and have lunch or dinner there so im giving it three stars
__label__0 2 stars because i really did like the eye doctor i saw she was awsome thought i was off to a good start getting new glasses i picked out my frames while i waited to be taken care of ohwaitthe eye glass gods had something else in store for me the person helping me couldnt get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours he actually told me i had to pay full price or come back tomorrow now keep in mind that i have had this insurance forever never had any problems before after hours weekends etc so i used my cell and called the insurance company i get someone on the phone who is trying to help us i put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone handed it back to me and said here you talk to her im done so the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesnt happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if i was sure i shouldnt switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior but i thought i was done i have my glasses picked out and i needed them to drive so while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear so i lost 12 hour of my time and think the worst is over wellthose darn eye glass godsi cant get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me he has the right lens and it was only 600 pm come back tomorrow so i called today and was told 12 hour and they will be ready i drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what they arent even close to being ready so i walk around the mall come back and guess what only 1 pair is ready that would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly i laugh it off and leave so what are the odds ill get my glasses after work today one can only wonder awful service unprofessional and unpleasant to experience
__label__1 i just had my first tammie coe cake last week for my birthday and i will never be the same again i dont normally eat cake in fact if its not brownies i dont eat it but this cake drew me in with its appealing fondant from there i got lost in the spongy richness of the cake a cornicopia of flaverful goodness so make a metal note to yourself i will only eat brownies and tamie coe cakes oh and special thanks to arts g previous review for telling me what the hell fondant is i was just calling it sheet like frosting
__label__1 appears to be closed phone number not in service went by last week was all locked up with a realtor sign on the building
__label__1 im not a big organic kind of guy i could care less about hormone free this and bpa free that for me it all about flavor and service it has to be better than i can make it myself and you have to take better care of us than i can having said that im head over heels in love with the food at tryst service is family oriented too they treat you like a regular on your first trip in the door and burgers are to die for as a diehard burger man this is my default stop it is close to the house in a pleasant shopping center and has the best burger ive ever eaten in phoenix id give it an extra half star if yelp would let me this place is that good
__label__1 i went here for my birthday this year the best part was my friends picked up the tab the food was fantastic when i found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club i knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice the only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubswell maybe that wasnt a bad thing after all
__label__1 dined outside its a must do when the weather is right fits nicely into the fashion square mentality an aura great appetizers and they did a great job on the steak well go back again sometime
__label__1 i like their seating area it has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store one of my favorite locations
__label__1 love it the food is very spicy though luckily i have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors however the wussies out there should take note just realize that this place is very small and can get very crowded i was there once and george w bush came in to eat there evidently he loves the food
__label__0 came here on a friday night to split some wings and a cheeseburger with the lady well if you want to split a burger they charge you 150 for this hmm why were my wings not charged an additional 150 i understand their thought process but we were not hungry enough to order 2 dishes and waste food also for a sports bar on a friday night i expect beers to be continually full not waiting 10 minutes in between ill be back for the wings and for a change but the customer service definitely will be remembered
__label__1 one of my favorite aspects of this central phoenix wine bar is that it is still somewhat undiscovered aka not teeming with hipsters and young professionals on a thursday evening after work it stays busy but not jam packed their happy hour is great nice 5 small plate options and you must try their cherry lemon drop martini seriously delicious get a ride from someone because youll probably want another the decor is cool and they play french movies on a large screen in the back of the restaurant i also have a special place in my heart for their awesome sweet potato fries this place is a great option if you want a nice glass of wine and a bite to eat in central phoenix but dont want to brave the postino crowds
__label__1 love this place its on our dinner rotation the owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars great place and cheap too try the 100 its the best ever
__label__1 ill be back laura certainly doesnt need my review for help but all of these people are correct she is meticulous easy to be around and takes joy in her work when i read all of the 5 star reviews i sort of thought they might be written by friends because they were so gushy i found her via yelp and loved her 20 eyebrow wax takes credit cards
__label__1 holy manfest 07 i think i was one of the 20 women not including the waitresses in tilted kilt yesterday it was raining men and i liked it a few minutes after entering the bar i knew exactly why i was surrounded by a sea of men the waitresses were barely wearing any clothes let me clarify they did have tiny skirts on even tinier tops and their bras were hanging out so i guess that constitutes as clothes the outfits were cute but extremely revealing so much so that even i had a hard time looking our waitress in the eye and i know the guys around me were having the same problem the bartenders all men were all pretty cute and wearing kilts all i kept thinking yesterday was that they must make some pretty damn good money to warrant wearing a skirt to work the food is pretty good too and their menu is extensive youll find the usual apps sandwiches tons of salads chicken fingers wings and so on but the real highlight of tilted kilt for me was when i found little purse hooks underneath the bar i thought that was awesome way to look out for the ladies tilted kilt
__label__1 i went to pei wei last night for a casual girls night dinner it was a perfect place for a group of girls to meet because of the following its cheap its fast casual so each person pays their own bill and then sits down no stress when the bill comes as is often the case with groups there is plenty to choose from on the menu for those that are picky or dieting they are great about special orders sauce on the side etc that being said pei wei is just average in my eyes never my first choice of places to go but i can always find something to eat last night i had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice the shrimp tasted like it came from the freezer probably because it did but the veggies rice and sauce were all pretty good i noticed they changed the menu a bit since my last visit and a new special is a vietnamese noodle bowl pho type dish the chicken lettuce wraps and edamame are always safe bets and hopefully will remain on their menu forever im sure ill be back to pei wei because of the positive factors listed above the concept is a good one just dont compare it to a high end restaurant and enjoy it for what it is ps shout out to all the girls that came out last night i had fun seeing all of you and cant wait for the next one
__label__1 dont go to dos for authentic mexican food or stellar service youll be disappointed go to dos for a fun atmosphere good happy hour and cheap bar food then youll be pleased dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town it has all the essentials food atm toilets and a huge selection of booze
__label__0 the food was ok waitress forgot my guacamole wait staff continually bumped into our table great wine list nice decor i may or may not try again not impressed by the food id go up to narcisse or true food instead
__label__1 i went here with a party of 4 on saturday night and it was surprisingly dead not that thats a bad thing because i dont like crowds the place is pretty sheik but you still feel like youre in a hotel service was fast and friendly but i think it was our waiters first night or something he was very awkward but it was ok i was pissed we couldnt get the happy hour menuprices in the main dining room i know it is common practice for crowded places full of douchebags but the bar and the main dining room were pretty empty so wtf im a vodka guy and their vodka menu is pretty neat they have 8 or 9 unique vodkas from around the us and clearly list their name where they are from and the price what i didnt like was their martinis pretty much the worst ive ever had anywhere tiny pours and full of ice chips it was like a vodka slushy oh snap i think i just invented something here is a rundown of the food bread to start excellentlove the lightly buttered and salted top tomato and mozzarella salad excellent one of the best ive ever had great dressing and ample balls of fresh mozzarella pretzel fondue the pretzels were excellent but the fondue and mustard were no bueno the fondu was gritty and the mustard lacked the kick that i love on pretzels burger pretty solid but nothing special mac n cheese with shriners sausage very unique and very tasty it was worth having once but i wouldnt get it again tater tots perfectly cooked saltycrunchy on the outside fluffy on the inside the only thing that would have made these better is some type of aioli or other special dipping sauce other than ketchup the main dishes of the other people in my party looked excellent i should have been more adventurous and gone with something more than a standard burger maybe next time i was going to give this place 3 stars but i just cant they try to think out of the box to create dishes that are unique have fresh ingredients and have a local twist i will return
__label__1 have been to pita jungle twice before feel the wait staff do a good job always friendly and good service best hummus in town for s dollar more get the bigger plate of hummus but ask for extra pitas 39 cents each and some extra cucumbers and tomatoes 99 cents not a fancy place but certainly someplace you want to try out
__label__1 one of my favorite places to get indian food im vegan so i love that there is so much to choose from my all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian im so glad udupi reopened
__label__1 growing up near this little hole in the wall this place was a constant stop for my family its really good greasy chinese food that basically tastes like you would expect it to now that i live farther away i still have cravings for their delicious orange chicken and chicken fried rice if youre nearby during lunch try out a lunch special really great prices
__label__1 blue 32 wins my mvp award i practically lived at this place during the giants world series run and loved every moment of it despite the fact that i am still stuck in an orange and blackout world series championship daze that will probably continue for at least another month or so i must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of scottsdale the service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching here are the main two reasons why i will keep coming back here 1 food this is the best bar food ever you must try their onion rings they are crazy delicious also if you arent in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well 2 tvs sports fans it doesnt get much better than this when it comes to tvs outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant no sports bar in scottsdale can compete with blue 32s tvs go here for a game and you wont be disappointed i decked myself out in orange and black screamed jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games overall blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and youve got to check this place out ps go giants
__label__1 soft opening so still working out the kinks food was deelish scallop poppers crispy and spicy not at all greasy honey chickena little sticky but so good teriyaki chickensubtler than other places teriyaki but much better flavor and chicken was tender tootzi roll bursting with flavor and rolled perfectly nice touches with cucumber water upscale asian decor unique glasses menus plates etc will definitely be back
__label__0 stopped in sunday for lunch after a high recommendation from a friend of mine in san diego she claimed it was the best sub shes ever had so i had to try it unfortunately my sub came up short with lack of taste and toppings when we pulled up i noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasnt as clean as others have stated in other reviews i had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor i had the chipotle cheese steak sub that i split with my husband the bread tasted ok but it wasnt fresh out of the oven they skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it for the price of the sandwich i really was expecting to get more the sauce was the best thing about it but i was wanting more of it as well i wont be going back sad that it wasnt a better first impression
__label__1 my eyebrows definitely needed some loveive ignored them so long that theyre starting to resemble 2 fat caterpillars and ill soon risk a unibrow if something isnt done stat did you say free waxing im a sucker for free stuff the center is very sterile not only in a clean and sanitary way but also void of any personality its a chain though and theyre trying to go for the european vibe so ill let them off the hook the gal who did my wax was really nice wore surgeons gloves and carefully applied this purple gooey wax to my face waited for it to dry then pulled it off it hurt a lot less than regular wax and the fact that it was purple made it just seem cooler all around i walked out 15 minutes later with clean brows and an appointment for my next wax definitely a good find
__label__1 brackins is my new favorite day drinking spot the bar itself is located perfectly within a tuckedaway area in the old town scottsdale mall area the atmosphere is very relaxed and when the owners swing by they really make an effort to get to know you prices are also very relaxed with bottled beer landing right around 3 for domestics all in all if you are looking for a spot to hang out with a couple drinks maybe enjoy some live music and do some people watching i would definitely recommend brackins
__label__1 great food freaky good service fantastic atmosphere highly recommend sitting on patio inside looked a bit loud patio is fantastic it is one of a few in phoenix where it doesnt overlook a parking lot this is my new favorite place to take visitors
__label__1 typical unpretentious dive bar where you can meet a friend after work play pool watch sports whatever theres a pretty big food menu too i had the nachos once and they were quite filling and tasty nice happy hour specials also i heard it was a place to watch ohio state sports but it was pretty dead when i went there to watch a football game however it was kind of nice getting a prime spot in front of a huge tv and the service was really good
__label__1 this is an awesome family owned business weve had consistently fresh and delicious food each time weve been here they homemake things like their ranch dressing to take them to a different level than other places highly recommend this place prices are not bad either
__label__1 this review is a little late coming but just got myself some fabulous chocolates and remembered how addicted i am to the passion fruit ones its a good things theyre so pricey or i would probably eat an entire box julia baker also did our wedding cake in 2010 the cake was a beautiful three tier red velvet it tasted amazing we still get compliments on it julia and all her employees were a joy to work with the tasting appointment was one of our favorite parts of wedding planning would definitely recommend lost a star because they are a tad bit overpriced also the design on our cake was the wrong color our wedding color was an olive green and the cake design was a bright almost neon green and we had asked for an olive or dark emerald color if there wasnt a million other things going on i might have stressed about it but as it were the cake tasted great enough to make up for it they didnt last too long at the montelucia which is usually when id stop in for a treat im not sure where they moved but i know that you can buy the truffles and chocolates seriously try the passion fruit at ajs fine foods in the area
__label__1 having a record store in the memorial union always made me nervous nearly everything in that building is specifically designed to rip students off and i didnt think that hoodlums could possibly be an exception fortunately that assumption was incorrect hoodlums had a diverse selection awesome sales and an incredibly knowledgeable staff the went well beyond the pop charts and were always helpful the atmosphere was nice particularly once they moved into the basement the store suffered smoke damage in a fire last autumn and the store is not going to reopen in the union on their website it states that it should reappear in the future in another location and i have my fingers crossed
__label__1 super cool coffee bar with a great outdoor patio for little ones to run around
__label__1 walking in was like seeing a rainbow for the first time uhmazing every type of candy ever created and more candies that youve never even heard of best part about it was that it was super affordable it was like a minicostco of just candy i ended up going twice on saturday love it
__label__1 i have been here at least 10 times and have never had a complaint the staff is friendly the food is great the atmosphere is lovely my favorites the lb lavosh and spicy cottage cheese i will continue to come back to local breeze again and again
__label__1 i am always on the prowl for a good burger so when i heard there was a new burger place in tempe i knew i had to try it out the boyfriend and i went to lobbys on a friday night it was not busy but the location doesnt really lend itself to busy so we were able to walk right in and order its an order at the counter and grab a seat kinda place we both ordered cheeseburgers and got an order of fries to share i liked that the burgers were not premade frozen patties they threw down two hunks of beef on the grill the burgers were tasty a nice size not too big not too small and the fixins were fresh so was the bun the fries were crinkle cut but they were crispy and good the atmosphere was fine good for a quick sitdown and the staff was friendly i hope they can survive in this location because they are worth a repeat visit for sure
__label__1 i love stax they introduced me to the world of quinoa their quinoa black bean burger is sensational i do the build your own burger and get garlic aioli and the house ketchup i am a big fan of their sweet potato fries as well the service has always been great and the prices are reasonable this is a good alternative to delux if you are in downtown scottsdale
__label__1 i have been to many thai restaurants in the valley and this is the one that i aways go back to their roasted duck is consistently good get the ped gang daeng 801
__label__1 move over maizies youve been replacedfor brunch that is i have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to maizies for their brunch and getting smashed oh and we eat a little too everything changed this weekend though when we went to postino on central for their brunch debut the food was so ridiculous good that we actually forgot to drink did you hear me forgot to drink since it was our first time there we ordered a variety of options i had the country toast which was toasted mj bread topped with italian ham gruyere cheese and a sunnyside up egg holy shit each bite became increasingly better than the last it was the perfect bite over and over and over again the ham had a nice little spice to it the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it the egg was well an egg and the toast really brought it all together incredibly and it was huge i barely got through half if it before i had to give up my brunch date got postinos take on french toast to be honest i am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning however i would have bathed in this french toast it was creamy not overly sweet and literally melted in my mouth i ordered a white peach bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute i completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal me ignoring anything in a champagne flute i know i feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy but im sorry maizies consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out
__label__0 i wish i could give this location a big fat zero but you cant but i can let everyone know how horrible it is for starters their automatic doors do not even work i just find that appalling how can your doors not work on your store how are people supposed to get in there to shop the manager of this location is nothing more than a jerk i asked for help and all i received was attitude for a struggling supermarket that filed for bankruptcy i would think service would be one thing you could promote at no cost but not here i dont think it will be long before this location closes rip
__label__1 fantastic happy hour 36pm half price appetizers and good drink prices i like their sushi and garlic noodles and pretty much everything ive had there is good i had a peppercorn steak about 2 weeks ago and it was amazing its right next to the movies so its a good place to meetup too
__label__0 okay now this is a large chain and on average its okay to good and i have been to this place many many times but i have to say the last time i went there for the happy hour hot wings they were dry over cooked then i had ordered a steak and seafood combo cajun something but after my second brew i thought it was me so i had the wife and my son taste it man was it salty it tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food but my waitress assured me that could not have happened because all there sauces come in bags and are premade gross that did it for me i was outta there with the quickness
__label__1 zupas officially opens today i was invited to their vip catering event a few days ago and was able to get a sneak peek the soups are very good i tasted all of them my favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor the shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little new orleans kick i recommend them both if you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy one thing i really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from i had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good you can get a 799 combo of any 2 items soup salad sandwich by the way its not 12 sizes with that combo either i got a full panini and full soup the soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks the ingredients are fresh and the employees are very friendly they also cater which is a big plus
__label__1 big fan of their sw chicken caesar salad and fire roasted tomato soup my favorite sandwiches are the chicken panini the turkey cranberry and the teriyakki chicken wrap i love both wildflower and paradise but paradise bakery has the best cookies and although i do not get it very often because its a killer in calories the chocolate cheesecake brownie is to die for
__label__1 love this place bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating the outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring but i gave it 5 stars for a reason and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time i acknowledge that this is a personal choice but if you go and try any of the sandwiches youll likely agree
__label__0 i am from nyc and have been in phoenix for a few months this native nyer is within walking distance from my hotel ive been going their for about two months on friday and saturday nights for food drinks and the karaoke the food was ok the drinks specials were good and the service was also good the problem is that when a confrontation erupted at the bar the staff did not respond quilckly to notify the police so i ended up geting injured and when i asked them to call the police the did not i had to and after the episode they said they hoped it would not affect me not coming back again not even a comp or something just an im sorry what happened i will not be returning at all i looked over my nine charges on my statements and seen i had spent over 300 their there loss
__label__1 weve eaten at this location quite a few times weve always enjoyed it the pizza is great and the employees are friendly we also threw my sons 6th birthday party here in sept our hostess assigned to our party was great and very patient with all the kids my son said it was the best party ever well definately be having more parties here
__label__1 when we first got here i felt disappointed until i realized the zoo is much larger than it first appears particularly worthy of checking out the lions and tigers also do not pass up the monkey walk the little squirrel monkeys are fun to watch be sure to shell out the extra bucks to feed the giraffes its a unique experience to be so close to these large yet gentle creatures definitely my favorite part of my visit visit date 111909
__label__1 one of my top choices for downtown phoenix always an upscale posh vibe but with very generous prices on entrees good looking people throughout this bar the kisras are very tasty and a good spin off the typical flatbreads at many restaurants now brunch here on saturdays or sundays great drink specials too
__label__0 i used to be a los sombreros local started going 1998 before they were in their current location the past few years los sombreros has gone hill increasing prices and food not as good margs are subpar now los sombreros is no longer living up to what it used to be food is still good just no longer great all great things change and i am sad to see los sombreros change for the worse the original chefowner jeff smedstad has left and started elote in sedona i must try there as i here its what los sombreros used to be
__label__1 mmm delicious indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes i love the fact that each dish is mildly spiced and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose im a spicy lightweight so it was great that i didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy i had a bowl of brown rice cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurtcucumbermint sauce on the side it was fantastic i cant wait to go back also i thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for making the drive to their location and to compensate for highgas prices a memorable gesture
__label__1 nice location good service but a little slow been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice overall i enjoy the food and would go back
__label__1 my friend refers to this place as hitlers bunker but i choose to see the romantic side of kazimierz i love the dark cool interior with the large comfy sofas and chairs it can be daunting to find a bottle of wine since the list is incredibly vast i usually settle for a wine flight like the french kiss or i open up the book to a random page and swirl my finger around until i land on a bottle in my price range the flat bread pizzas and fruit and cheese trays have been nothing but impressive some of the waitstaff can be a bit surly but most of the interactions have been quite positive all in all i think this is a superb place to take a date after a nice dinner so you can unwind
__label__0 third visit was lower than second which was lower than first excellent service but declining food quality bacon was chewy eggs ordered over hard were nearly raw in the middle manager was rude to me and snapping at the help who were doing a wonderful job must have been having a very bad day i might try them one more time but probably will move on to better places
__label__1 hip hop sandwich shop not a traditional dining experience food was great and prices were very great everything on menu was under 10 mac and cheese is worth ordering as an appetizer and the blt was rediculously delicious i look forward to going back again and probably again
__label__1 after 6 years of searching i have finally found laura my brows have never really been bad per se but not great eitheri have been searching for someone to show me the hidden potential of my natural arches and laura did just that after only two visits she has groomed my brows into perfect shape and balance its funny how such a small change can make such a big difference i also enjoy the quiet and private suite with the pretty chandelier to look at during my appointmentsand she always has great music playing in the background too thanks laura
__label__1 i have never written a negative review but unfortunately i think this place needs to get it together it is in a location that never seems to be successful i drug my husband over excited to try it and hoping to see an improvement no such luck no vegetarian entree not really kid friendsly small portions pricey not what we were looking for in an evening love to support new restaurants but wont be back hope they figure it out and make it work
__label__1 saw this place on triple d so i decided to give her try my expectations were high and when i arrived i was shocked that on a thursday morning the line was extra extra long had to wait patiently which when it comes to food i dont like but needless to say the wait was worth it because when i got in there i was served quickly i ordered the pork chop eggs and hash browns the pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good i would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of phoenix make sure to try the bacon too
__label__1 wow best breakfast i had on my recent trip to scottsdale ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically dont do side dishes that sweet little angel of a waitress made my day best corned beef hash ever have i mentioned how awesome the waitresses were and damn pretty as well double score
__label__1 i ordered the bbq sampler chicken pork beef and ribs yum then i washed it down with their red cream soda and root beer yum me satisfied
__label__0 ill agree that this is a great meet up place in the city nice neighborhood adequate parking in the structure behind and a greta atmosphere with great service the menu is interesting and id come back to try more but heres what our first visit was like as a starter we had the spinach quesadilla made with lavosh and it was great i mean really great and enough as a meal for two for that alone id go back my better half had the falafel pita and thought it was ok i had the gyros pita and got luncheon meat im talking precisely sliced straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warmup luncheon meat if you go online to see the menu its one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart heres what it reads for the meat gyro beef beef lamb water bread crumbs bleached wheat flour water dextrosesalt and yeast may contain soy bean oil calcium propionate soy protein concentrate less thean 2 salt garlic and onion powder monosodium glutamate so the takeaway here is stay away from the gyro but hey gyro is a pita i expected a reasonable execution heck make a gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least yes im bitter
__label__1 i visited carlys for a weekday lunch when i was downtown for work here is the rundown 1 parking is horrid common downtown so take the lightrail the stop is on central and roosevelt or bring a fist full of quarters for the meter 2 it is crowded well it was when i was there 3 the service was pretty good considering how swamped it was and i told the nice server i was in a hurry and she was able to take my order from soup to nuts in maybe 10 minutes even though their credit card machine was down 4 i ordered a gyro and their orzo pasta salad the gyro was mediocre and bland but the pasta was wonderful i will definitely try carlys again when i am not rushed the interior is hipster funky low key and the staff was very friendly
__label__1 i always enjoyed coming here after a long night of work the staff is amazingly friendly and always made my time here great the sliders are yummy and their appetizer platter they offer is great you can choose between a variety of different munchies over all i recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a low key bar atmosphere
__label__0 the pedicure was nice i will give them that but lady must have wanted 2 close shop early that day as i told her i wanted a pedi an acrylic manicure when i first walked in she asked another customer to come back the next day while i was getting pedi needless to say i didnt get my acrylic set and towards the end i could tell she was 12 arsing it and they were a lil pricey i mean really 5 for taking off my nail polish i would give this place 1 star but they did do a good job on the pedicure not returning here
__label__1 decent food at not unreasonable prices the service is good what is up with the hyper aggressive pigeons on the patio the waitresses actually pass out squirt guns to the the customers to fend off the ever persistent waves of the foul fowl at the end of your patio experience there is a certain sense of camaraderie shared with the other patrons
__label__0 ive only been here once and for good reason to put it nicely the service was seriously lacking i walked in and nothing they didnt ask if i needed help looking for something greet me or even acknowledge me until i was about to pay i guess the magazine the cashier was reading was very important ive been to several comic book stores and i dont need someone to hold my hand i would just like common courtesy on the positive it was a organized place and the selection was pretty good
__label__1 if you like beer youll love papago they have a huge beer selection and the prices are very good when ever im in scottsdale i make it a point to visit them
__label__1 elmer i love you i have since i was a senior at chandler high back then i was broke so i could only get a bean burrito and stripsand they were dang good if anyone wants to complain about strips just being chips and cheese they can suck it now days i am a little less broke so i always get the green chili burro and it is always so good spicy enough to burn a little and the tortilla is always freshthanks man and bless your little mexican heart you serve corn dogsso i can even come here with my crazy picky kids i love you elmer i always will
__label__1 i have only been here once and it was for a quick drink before heading to a movie but this place is my kind of hang if you are a laid back bar who supports local artists has a huge selection of boozahol and plays music that makes my heart skip well then i guess i just love you plus its on the same street as my favorite jobot coffee how could i not like the lost leaf right i really love that it is a really old house turned into a bar the artist inside me wants to shoot tons of photography there perhaps one day i will be that girl who brings her huge slr camera to the bar i will need to go when it is last friday to hear some jams and revisit this gem of a bar this is the kind of place ill miss when i no longer live in the phx
__label__1 julio gs lunch menu offers some very delightful dishes i recommend the beef flautas special with rice and beans the wait staff was very nice and efficient good group restaurant spot
__label__0 ok im not getting the great reviews on this place i finally made it lamars before they closed for the day and tried a couple donuts i have a few problems here the big one can we please list that only the donuts with holes are 549 for 6 its a bit deceptive to just list the price of 6 and ring up the donuts and have them turn out to be well over 7 makes me want to buy my donuts from someone else second these donuts are way over priced and they are average at best the maple bar tastes like you are eating spoon fulls of sugar they are so sweet and the rest of the donuts i tried were pretty stale this will be the first and last time i will be going to lamars give me krispy kreme or anyone else for that matter thank god for lamars we dont have spudnuts in the valley because they would be out of business
__label__1 these dentists are great at explaining medical issues in a way that you can understand they are honest and very smart they dont take my insurance and i still go there lets face it dental insurance doesnt reimburse much so its only like a 15 difference for me to go out of network for a cleaning i would never go anywhere else
__label__1 the mall of malls for sure so many designer boutiques so little time on this trip i was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the fossil storewhat fun they were i enjoyed a smoked chicken black bean salad z tejas next and the service was excellent i then perused the new styles at aqua before finding a great pair of shades at solstice shoppers bliss this review is a bit late i visited the center on 12712 and ill be back
__label__1 i love lulus cupcakes they always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles this is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better i love the raven the sales people are nice so yummy and i love that the place is pink
__label__1 we were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned we all loved it that is saying a lot we ordered off the online menu and i called it in she was very friendly it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious it also doesnt cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often we will be back
__label__1 the pizza is incredible they use really high quality ingredients and the prices are great i would recommend cooking it on the bottom rack of your oven for a slightly better texture on the crust i want someone to mark that this post is funny so i will add a joke mushroom walks into a bar bartender says sorry we dont serve your type here mushroom says why not im a fungi fun guy
__label__1 very nice views of phoenix not a very challenging hike but very enjoyable gets steep at the very top but a couple of hard steps will get you to a nice view
__label__1 the last time i was at the vig they tricked me you see they have these glass doors that they open up in the back of the restaurant when its nice out and sometimes when you go through those doors from the outside to take a trip to the loo they close them on you so like an asshole you attempt to walk back outside the way you came but instead you bash your head and knees into the glass window in front of 35 people be mindful of this but hey at least they had the most amazing wine specials that night and i was saucy enough to laugh it off and take a bow and then i hid in the bocce ball pit for the remainder of the evening where i somehow acquired 200 bruises i love the vig even when im embarrassing the shit out of myself
__label__0 i cant even believe i actually went to this restaurant my feeling was that if the tommy bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so let me be clear that im not a food snob at all just last week i enjoyed a lunch of nachos bell grande and a bean and cheese burrito at taco bell very very much that was far superior to this lunch at tommy bahama the decor was comfortable and breezy everything else not so much 1st its nice that they bring you bread and butter but a sweetly flavored butter why mess with the pure goodness of butter the glass of lemonade i ordered was sickeningly sweet and i am a notorious for my sweet tooth it was undrinkable until i cut it with water the coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce so much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp i got the crab bisque which was crazy salty and in my opinion contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat as it was my friends birthday they brought him a complimentary dessert very nice he got the newest one which was some sort of chocolatecaramelfilled cake with oreo crust chocolate mousse topping sprinkled with crushed heath bar sounds good right vile absolutely vile overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter on an update note it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though my final issue was with our young highly attentive server he was very sweet and wellintentioned however i feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective dont say are we enjoying our coconut shrimp or are we ready for dessert unless ive badly misinterpreted our relationship we arent doing anything together just a pet peeve i still tipped him 22 and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy quesadilla cup of crab bisque lemonade and glass of white wine 52 for lunch tommy bahama and i just didnt work out at all
__label__1 i flew out of and into this airport for the holidays the process was painless once inside the airport but their setup with the roads ramps and terminals is so absolutely convoluted ive never been to a more confusing airport with regards to traffic that being said once inside it was quick to checkin and get my bags checked i also was traveling with my puppy who was so warmly welcomed by everyone staff and otherwise they had no issue with him being out unlike other airports a huge perk is a dog park they have outside terminal 4 to walk dogs beforeafter flying made me feel a lot less nervous about the 5 hour trip across the country and im sure it made my dachshund a lot happier too
__label__1 meh i am surprised to read all the reviews about the clean store everyone else wrote about in my experience the toppings area looked like it had all merged to become one big nest there were also speckles and swipes of froyo in all places imaginable floor counters scale and i wanted to try a couple flavors but there was no one around to help also the checkout lady was soooooo dreary with her monotone listlessness she made me feel as depressed as sylvia plath just kidding but she couldnt have been more doldrums if she tried i usually go to yogurtology at town country mall on camelback just east of the 51 that place is always amazing pristine clean neat organized always a peppy guy by the machines with little sampler cups a guy who had one too many red bulls and is nearly throwing at least one sample of every single flavor at every single person who walks in the door with a funny witty little quip and a great personality and way too damn much energy but its nice that is what i had in mind when i discovered this place i was excited it was so much nearer to my house great location stupid layout though prone to human traffic jams i really really want to like yogurtland but i just cant talk myself into it the froyo was good aside from the fact that i had trouble getting toppings without being too grossed out since it was a mess but that was about it all in all theyre lucky i felt generous today and gave them 3 stars because i really had to talk myself out of giving them only 2 jessica
__label__0 i have read several raving reviews of this place i was disappointed the first time so i went back again thinking i had an off experience i was still disappointed i had the carne torta the first time and the cubana the second the food was okay not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places i can name off the top of my head the first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone for 6 or 7 bucks id expect a little more here are a few places with much better tortas los reyes de la torta 7th st hatcher el gallo blanco central indian and el nopalito 24th st and thomas
__label__1 a perfectly good place for a chill friday night dinner i absolutely loved the atmosphere mattas has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level it feels like your in a courtyard the only thing its missing is an open look at the sky there was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal and to make things really cool at least to me they did a mexican version of the godfather theme song loved it the chips and salsa came out right away the hot had a kick to it but wasnt very flavorful the mild was excellent but i prefer my salsa hot i tried combining the two which was only okay the menu isnt really anything special its a lot smaller than most mexican restaurants and is loaded with the standards my girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed i had the chicken fajitas which were good as well the food was good but not great enough to make me run back out the service was excellent our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level we watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs she usually took the stairs that werent as visible but you know whats going on to get everything for us i could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day they would just make people up there and wait we just randomly chose mattas because we happened to be at mesa riverview i enjoyed my experience there while its not a place that im dieing to try again if someone suggests mexican and were nearby id recommend it
__label__0 walked in during late lunch hour did not get acknowledged for about 5 mins when i finally got sat down and served my salad i found a hair in it got no apology just a sigh firm the waitress when she took it away you cant pay me to go back here the waiters are rude
__label__1 my son loves the splash pad his dad or uncles stay with him at the playground while i can run in the store or two that i need to there are quite a few empty retail spots hopefully they can get some new stores in there as well
__label__1 i have been chipotle faithful for about 2 years now and it wasnt very difficult restaurants such as rubios and the blue burrito just didnt stack up to a chipotle burrito then came qdoba this restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of chipotle 2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former chipotle of choice i had a chicken burrito my chipotle norm so i could make as direct of a comparison as possible the food was great and afterwards i didnt get that punched in the stomach feeling that chipotle gives me for some time after i eat it i am convinced their rice expands in your stomach but it tastes good so i suffer through it i also picked up their frequent customer swipe card buy 10 burritos get one free free chips and salsa after activation this place is closer to my place than any chipotle so i will be coming very often ps if anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know kudohba
__label__1 i seriously cant get enough of this spicy goodness all i ever wanna go is siam and nowhere else ive been to so many thai restaurants in az the past month and nothing compares to siam beef ma sa man curry is so addictingly amazing and the pad thai is always cooked to perfection im actually craving it as i type this
__label__1 i want to like turf but the food is just okay ive only been here twice but it was not mindblowing im not fond of the shepherds pie here it is the most bland version i have had even in this town the wings however are pretty good ive eaten wings here with a couple harps and have had a decent time surprisingly good is their seared ahi tuna it is pretty weird to think an irish pub would do this well but they do a friend ordered it and after shaking my head and saying theres no way it could be good i tried a bite and i had to eat crow turf is typically a stop on the pub crawl so i will definitely be back again for boozing
__label__1 very laid back very clean this was my first piercing since i was a little kid i had my tongue piercing it was very professional and they answered all of my questions i went to this place specifically because of the good ratings they had online my friend also had a tragus piercing here that went seamlessly also i felt very safe and comfortable
__label__1 pizzeria bianco before and after cited as the best pizza in america in numerous online reviews as well as on good morning america and as published in slice of heaven to most pizza lovers the three to four hour wait for a table is so daunting that they push on to a more open table atmosphere for their pizza experience but to the true pizza enthusiast pizzeria bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food this place is best known for the owner chris bianco hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every tuesday through saturday from 510 pm for nearly 15 years of which i was one of those fortunate customers however early 2010 chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his protégé of 15 years horatio hernandez my decision to try pizzeria bianco for the first time came from a challenge i put upon myself find the best food in metropolitan phoenix after hearing about pizzeria bianco from a friend i made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009 i knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened and this beautiful fall day was no exception i arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to bar bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while i held our place in line seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us we assumed we would make the 500 seating with no trouble however just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party so were the 20 or so people ahead of us and when the door opened promptly at 500 there were now over 50 people ahead of us needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time when we were seated at 600 the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of evoo with a touch of balsamic added we ordered three pizzas the sonny boy providing salami marinara sauce and gaeta olives the wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the marinara with prosciutto di parma all three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced we left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 adams in phoenix for another slice of heaven and so after hearing of the departure of chris from the kitchen curiosity got the best of me i had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time the food quality or the overall experience i had truly fallen for april 6 2010 again i ventured down to 623 adams in phoenix to see if a tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all my date and i arrived at approximately 400 pm one hour before the doors would open we found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said almost in unison well the wait hasnt changed bob trotted off to bar bianco to find our pale ale four peaks to help pass the time we caught a glimpse of owner chris bianco and i told bob how i would love to chat with him seeing as i was writing a comparison review i also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight bob stalked chris into bar bianco and asked him if he had any time would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions when bob returned with another beer and chris bianco in tow i was star struck and could barely speak all i could muster up was are you cooking tonight to which he replied no i have horatio at the oven i cant cook anymore i explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same we took a picture and off he went back to the bar at 615pm after 225 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar we ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the marinara the overall experience was better for me as i got to enjoy personal time with chris as for the meal it was just as amazing as i remembered it from 6 months prior with chris tossing the pie for every customer the flavors were exactly as i remembered and the service from the staff was top notch just like the first time from the wait to the taste it didnt appear that anything had changed so what makes for the best pizza in america and how did pizzeria bianco get the tag line well my opinion is flavorful ingredients a phenomenal social experience and an owner who lives by what he serves to chris bianco and the pizzeria bianco staff you havent skipped a beat
__label__0 my boyfriend and i tried this place last year and we havent been back since the food was really unspectacular they werent really that hot the price is a bit high since theres a restaurant by the same name on southern and dobson that serve much better food for less the decor was really tacky and they should paint over the mural it does not appeal to their clientele lastly the staff was not nice
__label__1 the boy and i finally check this place out last night it was everything i imagined it to be great view from the semioutdoors bar area lots of beers on tap and nice patio area it was a monday night so they werent very busy which was nice i wasnt in the mood for a crowed when checking out their menu online i saw they have my favorite beer on tap seadog wild blueberry it was delicious completely different on draft but yummy all the same they also had an apple cider on draft my pick over a pear cider any day that i could have in my black velvet cider and guinness i was a happy camper only downer was that they closed a bit earlier than we would have liked but no worries we will just have to come back again soon to try some more beers the bartender was great she let us try anything we wanted before committing to a full on pint i tried to get the boy to be adventurous but he stuck with the stella not bad at all just a little boring oh well i am looking forward to checking out standup live soon as well and the live bands they have at copper blue i also hear they ahve a pretty awesome ladies night on thursdays saweet menty menty more trips in my future i can just see it
__label__1 this time we didnt do carryout definitely better when you eat there this place is like pei wei very large chunks of meat vegatables neverjust like pei weitheir priceless warning hot tea is available for 200 brown rice instead of white also 200 the soups are terrible
__label__1 the food is good and the location is perfect a solid breakfast spot in oldtown everything on the menu looks fantastic i went the healthy route this morning and went with the quick start conscious 4 egg whites broccoli tomato fruit and cottage cheese phenomenal for a healthy breakfast out breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups the only real negative is the outside seating it seemed good in theory on a cool day in scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies however being right on scottsdale road it was hard to hear the people i was eating with because of all the passing traffic id advise that anyone dining here eat inside where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy
__label__0 my wife and i were downtown with some friends and decided to check this place out i ordered a pasta lunch and chose penne alla campagna and another penne with tomatoes and mozzarella meh it was just okay the food was just okay kind of bland and a bit overpriced i did snag a small slice of pepperoni pizza from one of the kids at our table that was actually the best part of my meal would i go back nope no sir
__label__1 this would most certainly be my coffee shop if i hadnt already established myself as a regular at another local shop this brandnew independent coffee shop has spent the money to look really nice it even has a fountain inside but what money cant buy is community and unfortunately this shop doesnt seem to have much of that granted building community takes time andor energy for their sake i really really hope it works out in the longrun
__label__1 great activity for kids its clean spacious and safe
__label__1 i like the lunch better than the breakfast at first watch which is a bit ironic i suppose perhaps it should be named second watch but on to what i do like the not guilty your honor veggie wrap is good it comes with a side of hummus fruit and potatoes big meal the burrito vera cruz breakfast burrito was pretty good the vera cruz sauce is a mixture of salsa and hollandaise ive never had it before trying it here and it was actually pretty tasty mango iced tea is good and theyll give you some to go if you ask somethin about the potatoes just doesnt cut it for me though and as i mentioned earlier the breakfast just isnt my favorite i just dont dig their omelets much sign up for their email club to get a buy 1 get 1 free meal coupon note if youre vegan order the veggie wrap and substitute avocado for the feta cheese get a side of salsa too
__label__1 the food was flavorful and plenty of it eating with only your fingers is quite fun make your momma proud my girlfriend won the best dish of the night lentils and chicken and cabagecarrots it all had kind of sweetishbitterishspicy flavor i had the lamb and jalapeño dish which was kind of greasy you eat with your fingers and can scoop up the food with the bread they give you a tartish type crepe which goes well with the food id be happy to go back and try something different if you are used to frozen pizzas and burger king you might want to stick with that as this experience might bit be as enjoyable as those who are more open to what they consume
__label__1 burger was good bun really soft and veggies were fresh sweet potato fries were very good as were the rings i knock them for not having cheddar cheese cant really have a stellar burger without it the burger quest continues
__label__1 i finally found a reasonably priced salon and a stylist who understands what i want very happy with the service also the waxing lady is very nicei think her name is maria does good eyebrows only downside is that sometimes it is hard to get an appointment on short noticebut thats my fault for waiting until i cant stand it anymore to get my hair cut
__label__1 other then the chips and salsa 5 stars for salsa the food is good but not so much that i go out of my way to eat there the fajitas are delish with mushrooms and the meat always tender but the price makes me cringe at over 20 there are so many other places i rather eat i usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole which is always yummy but pricey and i still pay for all that 15 plus what ever we are drinking i love the overly rustic atmosphere but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub some of the servers are not the friendliest but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever so dont take it personally but overall it is a scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good
__label__1 just tried this place this afternoon very friendly staff great rates with no commitments you dont need to worry about paying some 2540 co pay like at a regular chiropractics office each time you visit its 49 a month and you get four visits a month its not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit this goes month to month try it out once for 19 if you want this company is really growing so stop by and see for yourself
__label__1 we love 5th and wine and recommend it to anyone that asks the appetizers and wine specials for happy hour are some of the best in town lets start off with the fact that every glass of wine on the wine list thats right every glass is just 5 during happy hour from 3 6 pm did someone mention appetizers yep 5th has you covered there too ever tried fried pickles love them but i have to admit it took some convincing to win us over thanks scott the fried pickles are thinly cut fried to perfection and served with a creamy horseradish sauce for dipping but what 5th and wine is really known for at happy hour is their bruchetta they have 6 types to try but may we recommend this selection of our favorites apple and brie tomato basil and mozzarella and the steak and horseradish its a great threesome as someone mentioned last night the bread is not too hard very flavorful and toasted just right read the entire review here httpschmoozeazcomblogp680
__label__1 fnb is how every restaurant should be unfortunately this will not happen because pavle milic who runs the place cannot be at every restaurant this is a small friendly restaurant in my hood that just happens to have some of the best food you will find i always feel welcomed taken care of by the staff ive come here with friends but ive also come alone felt totally welcome i like sitting up at the counter and ive actually met some really great people to chat with there pavle his wife run the place they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there chef charlene does things with food that make it amazing these are things that i myself could never accomplish my main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu i just wish i had the funds to eat here more often in conclusion fabulous food combined with wonderful service make me feel lucky to have fnb in my neighborhood
__label__1 this place is great for a big group of people we originally thought we were going to have 6 people we ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up the staff was more than happy to accommodate us the kota athenian chicken is very good the price range is moderate all in all a fantastic place
__label__0 these are not real french treats im surprised some of the reviewers say theyve been to paris first of all theyre not macaroons those are jewish coconut cookies they are macarons one o and these were the most amateur macarons ive seen the feet are big the feet are the rim of the cookie and the cookie body itsself is airy and thin whereas a true macaron is light but doesnt actually have air pockets in it the cookie dough is still present throughout the filling is not ganache like it should be its a buttercream like you use for cupcakes chocolate croissant was decent so ill add a star for that
__label__1 i was visiting tempe for ironman arizona and came down with pretty acute foot injury three days prior to the race the friendly receptionist at dr natchers office understood the predicament i was in and managed to fit me into dr natchers schedule within a couple hours of my call dr natchers is clearly both a great doctor and a great person she is extremely competent friendly and sympathetic as an runner and cyclist she is also in tune with sports injuries and the mentality of an athlete she quickly diagnosed the injury and prescribed an aggressive treatment protocol i was in good shape on race day due to her treatment protocol and am so very thankful to dr natcher for putting me in the position to complete the race in fine fashion i was paying outofpocket and was very pleasantly surprised by the cost of the office visit i cant speak highly enough of my experience with dr natcher
__label__1 was super duper busy when i ordered but then again they were a fast food place and i waited for my to go order for 25 minutes they have 5 or 6 people inside their kitchen and a lot were waiting for their food cos there were some mixed up will go back though cos i know those things happen when its a busy day the food was bomb specially the hotdog
__label__1 i love the fish tacos from rubios i always order them well sometimes i get the shrimp or salmon tacos and i also love that black salsa chipotle sauce and the chips are delish here
__label__0 i had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby and this pizza still tasted horrible barely average fast food quality and taste avoid
__label__1 my girlfriend i love love love this place excellent food beers and wine to enjoy on premises friendly helpful and funny staff a wonderful grocery to shop from and an amazing selection of cheese and wine its a total foodie destination this place is fantastic ahwahtukee and phoenix in general needs more quality driven food and wine centric places like this
__label__1 just a quick review to reiterate how truly great this place is theyve got soda lots of soda thats right i said soda theyve got root beer sarsaparilla freaky foreign sodas teas waters and other things i love this place i have no complaints the only thing that would make this place better would be the addition of beer man if these guys hooked up with the dudes that run the beer section of topps liquors it would be unstopable
__label__1 for some reason or another this macys has a better selection of shoes than the one at scottsdale mall in the past year i found a pair of calvin klein sandals for half off and they carry the higher end younger brands which is great nordstroms selection tends to be for an older crowd
__label__1 we went there right before my grandmas 100th birthday there were about 20 of us the place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didnt have a final count of people the place was busy but i know why everyone had a different dish and we all loved it everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much we all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had the staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat
__label__1 another new great place in the arcadia neighborhood to grab some great food and select a drink from the extensive beer and wine list i think there were over 60 beers and 40 wines to choose from i thoroughly enjoyed the tomato and candied pancetta bruschetta and the lamb keftayummy definitely check this place out when the weather is cooler and you can enjoy the view of camelback mountain from the patio
__label__1 scale of 110 multiple visits 8 food 8 service 9 atmosphere 8 value love it the wines are good and they have drink specials 5 glasses and the place looks great and its light railable the panini was good not special but the creme brule made me forget all about it and work and oil spills and life thank god my bodys innate intelligence didnt forget about breathing or bladder control those stayed intact and the bruschetta what what
__label__0 phoyuck this place i was tricked in to going here with promises of great vietnamese i was ready for a culinary adventure and what i got was a ride in the fright house the bánh xèo was so greasy i couldnt eat it it was literally served on a plate of grease the bun was about the same it lacked flavor the rice noodles were slimy the spring roll was loaded with grease i ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass the service was horrible and i will not be back
__label__1 i really enjoyed my stay here we used a groupon and i will stay there again when i visit arizona the rooms were very tidy bath and body works collection available for shampoo and soap i loved how the pool was open all night as well the pool and hot tub did need a bit of scooping because there was some debri in there but nothing terrible towels were available as well as water too for the guests the front desk people were very pleasant and gave us an early check in no problem my fiance and i wanted to go down to mill avenue and were pleasantly surprised when the front desk said there was a 24 hour complimentary shuttle that would take us and pick us up the driver was very helpful with advice on places to go and also tips to keep out of trouble we went to milagros for a margarita too and the bartender was very pleasant and the drinks were not crazy expensive the hotel is very close to arizona mills mall and other places in tempe it was worth every penny
__label__1 great food and very friendly service happy to recommend
__label__1 i love love love coffee bean i have been in love with coffee bean for years i am so bummed out that they are not all over the place like the s coffee store one of my favie drinks are the pure cholocate ice blended with whip cream and green tea latte the service is always friendly perky and fully of sunshine
__label__1 threestar service but fivestar ambiencefour estrellas lets face it marina restaurants dont have to push too hard to succeed competition along the shoreline is minimal when the cooler runs low on the boat lakeside restaurant is the only show in town you can tie up at the little restaurant dock where the sign warns of a 30 minute limit which is laughable given the snailpaced service sit on the patio and toss a few crumbs to the waiting ducks and further down the food chain the circling iridescent bigmouth carp feathered scaled and furry scavengers vie for patio scraps the water is clear and calm and the view stunning the coffee is weak and watery if plentiful and the omelettes are big and fluffy if bland the heavily inked wait staff is polite if a little rough around the edges but props to folks who are sturdy enough tackle a fulltime wilderness gig like this note these are the best restrooms within 20 miles
__label__1 after a year in the valley one of my girlfriends took me to side bar i really like the atmosphere it was sleek yet cozy the night we went in it was hopping but not overly crowded a welcome sight considering much of my first year in the valley was spent in crowded pretentious scottsdale hotspots as i get older i crave more intimate setting and sidebar fits the bill also i give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause sidebar is just that kind of establishment if anyone is on twitter follow buzzcation sidebarphx has let buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours its a cool crew so come out and joing and i commend sidebar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples
__label__1 a very good sandwhich shop my boy and i stopped in here after a movie at the amc they have a neat concept with the bags on the wall where you mark your items my only wish is that they had cold sandwhiches as well as the toasted variety i am not always rarely in fact in the mood for a toasted sandwhich the italian sandwhich i got though was delicious nom nom nom
__label__1 consistanly great steaks and flavor for sure today was our maybe 10th visit to texas rh and we keep coming back todays waitress stacie was an absolute ditz and lets just say its a good thing i was in a good mood my ribeye was as tender and tasty as i expect wife tried the ribs for the 1st time and they were tender for sure bring your appetite and some time if you come frisat after 530 as i am sure you will enjoy as well
__label__1 we attended this restaurant for an early seating at 5 pm and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere and professional staff both were first class we decided to sit at the counter overlooking the chefs preparing the food and we were glad we did one young fellow was more than happy to answer any questions we had regarding the preparation as well as the presentation of the food it really was fun to watch the whole process we decided to go straight to the entree instead of filling up on an appetizer beforehand and we were glad we chose to do that we each ordered the kobe vaca encebollada which was a grilled kobe skirt steak nestled on a bed of caramelized onions alongside the steak were three slices of potato about a half inch thick and these were topped with a guacamole type mixture as well as other toppings they were absolutely delicious and i was so sad to reach the end of those the steak was cooked to absolute perfection and i was determined to clean my plate because it too was just so scrumptious it was a very ample portion and we did clean our plates and definitely had no room for dessert unfortunately as our cocktail we followed another reviewers lead and ordered virgin mojitos which were 950ea and they were delicious and also sufficed as a dessert standin so the tab wasnt too crazy at all well worth it for that delicious steak we did dress up for the occasion and were glad we did as everyone was dressed casually but nice its fun to have the whole experience for a special night out we look forward to returning soon
__label__1 yes i am a fan particularly of the brunches they bake their pancakes which makes them ooooh so good the kings cakes are delicious and are baked with bananas and chocolate in them and served with peanut butter which im personally not a fan of the portions are very very generous on a nice day the patio is great comfy seats evap cooler outside misting system most people dont know about their brunches i assume since the entire place was empty when we were there at 10am the dinners are great as well the pulled pork sandwich and their pizzas are surprisingly good it definitely has a commercial feel to it but i believe its a local business which im all for
__label__1 my super close local taco shop for me consistency is key and filibertos is always a step above most other restaurants ending with tos in that regard im fairly mental for their chicken soft tacos on corn tortillas larger than a typical street taco they are almost sized more like a mini burrito shredded chicken a red pepper sauce lettuce and melted cheddar awesome tuesdays they are only 1 all day finally their adobada tacos are a bargain at thrice the price avoid the chili relleno burrito however it may be one of the worst things to ever get passed through a drivethru window
__label__1 while i dont like to hype places up because really how good can any one place be how good can one burger joint be over another or how good can pizza be over another pizza place when weighing the ones that are all generally good in the public opinion now the word around town is that the grind is sofaking great i will say about the grind that when youre up for a burger this place hits the spot ive been here once before august 2010 dont remember what burger i had but recall it was good and the other night i had the peppercorn burger and it was as good as it gets i was starving and really hadnt eaten all day and that helped add to how much this hit the spot but make no mistake it was really good and i do enjoy this place for the atmosphere service and quality of food my friends wife got one of those healthy wraps and she liked it a lot the sweet potato fries we ordered the half sweet potato and half regular fries and they were good as for some other areas to review the atmosphere is nice its casual and not too dark and not too light inside thats how i like it theres multiple flat panel tvs above the bar so plenty of games on at any given time thats also how i like it the service is fine although based on some other reviews people have been so so satisfied about the service thats often going to be the case with most casual establishments so sometimes its good and sometimes not to our satisfaction such is life anyway back on track here the wait staff and bar staff have been worth the 20 tip both times no complaints by me about this place however i do see some 2 and 3 star ratings on here where i will dock 1 star and sort of agree with kristi d she mentioned the large photo of sheriff joe arpaio on the wall while i sense that kristi doesnt care for sheriff joe im neutral about him but i agree about all the oversized photos of notable names in town who have dined in the grind id much rather see real artwork or real photographs on the wall and not photos of sheriff joe mark grace for those who dont know hes a former baseball player and the mayor of paradise valley all holding their burgers who the hell cares about any of them and their burgers i think id be more ok with having these photos above me but they are huge enlargements and a bit overkill and they are for sale and the proceeds go to some cause look im all for causes and shit but i wouldnt spend my money on a 36 inch enlargement of these local notables holding a burger the whole concept is pretty stupid but hey im generally uptight and been doing photography 20 years and probly am just hating on the fact that my photos are hanging on the wall side note for those who might have previously had liked the grind on facebook but no longer have their page as a like its because they apparently had their group page hacked so they had to start over i found this out when i liked it the other day noticed there were only about 165 likes and certainly i knew this place was way more popular than that when i commented that they commented back about it being hacked and starting the page over httpwwwfacebookcomthegrindarcadia
__label__1 had lunch at zinc for the first time recently right as they were opening considering they were not yet busy we had pretty mediocre service to begin with we were not offered bread since it was our first visit i wouldnt have necessarily assumed we would get bread but i noticed other tables had it so naturally i felt slighted and then the cardinal sin of serving i was maybe 25 through my meal when our server appeared with our check and asked if we would like dessert well i dont know i havent really eaten yet my husband wasnt even finished and he eats like hes still in the military needless to say i just took the check and shortchanged her tip in return for shortchanging the time i was apparently allotted for eating as for the food i had the macaroni au gratin with smoked ham as well as their up sell of parmesan truffle fries i liked the mac and cheese not the best ive had but pretty good the fries were okay but ive never understood the concept of dressing up plain ole french fries and serving them with ketchup if im not going to get a nice aioli or some other special dipping sauce id rather just have the fries sans all the other crap i wouldnt necessarily object to a return visit if im in the area but i wont be breaking down their door just as well i doubt they would care
__label__1 great ice cream but still just ice cream really enjoyed the salted caramel alongside a scoop of sweet corn feel a little silly for driving from phoenix just for the taste but no complaints
__label__1 this place is an experience i cant stop thinking about it i love the weird odd flavors basil lime and everything tastes so fresh and organic its nice to have something like this close by our house a true guilty pleasure
__label__1 had a friend invitetake me to lunch here at the mission the physical place was great i had the arepas which were good not great my friend had the tacos which immediately upon being served them he realized hed have to order something else small portion my portion for the arepas was plenty as the venezuelan sandwich itself is filling but also came with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries which were good actually the ketchupdipping sauce was awesome now that i think of it price hmm a bit overpriced for lunch in my opinion but i suppose that is scottsdale thats really what was the difference between a 3 and 4 star for me here
__label__1 my girlfriend and i were hungry and wanted to try something new so we hopped on the netbook and fired up yelp we tried crazy jims and boy was this a good pick when we 1st rolled up to cjs my girl was like i dont know about this i said lets just go in and take a look if it is clean inside then lets try it once inside the place was small but quaint and most important it was clean so i ordered a veggie pita and got the pasta salad as a side the food was ready pretty fast and i had envisioned something like a sandwich that you pickup and eat but it was all laid out over my plate the pita was very good and i give a big thumbs up to the pasta salad was kinda plain my girl has a greek salad and she liked it but wasnt too crazy about the dressing i would definitely go back to crazy jims and eat as a matter of fact anytime i am craving that veggie pita your boy e will come to visit ps our server was great also friendly fast and helpful
__label__0 they must have had a slammed lunch as i came in around 130 by the time i found my way back from the old station and for a new place the counters were dirty i hate when the counter help is eating in the dining room i feel like i am inconveniencing them the vegetarian choices are limited and the pho was good for 8 bucks i have eaten pho at another place in mesa and enjoyed it more i wont run back to this one but if someone else was paying and wouldnt cave to other suggestions i would not die of it either
__label__1 after driving by this place about a million times i finally remembered it when the old where shall we go to eat question came up and i am now definitely a fan i asked the server chico he was great and seemed to really love working there about his recommendations and tried the salmon spinach enchilada which will be difficult to move on from when i go back it was absolutely amazing and i tried my hardest to finish my plate only reason i did not give this place five stars is that the ambiance in the back room was a bit lacking it was more cafeteriastyled and just not very warm and inviting regardless i know that i will be back and definitely introduce this place to out of town guests
__label__1 hes been the top votegetting general dentist in phoenix magazine for three years in a row for a reason folks he has an office in chandler and in mesa but even if you live in minnesota hes worth the drive
__label__1 during the work week i have to eat out for lunch quite a bit and i get tired of paying 10 for lunch i remembered hearing something about boston market having a 5 lunch special so i figured i would go check it out finally there is a place that has good somewhat healthy and well priced lunches your choice of carver sandwich with soupsalad and a drink they have soup and salad and i cant remember the others but it was a pretty nice selection you pay more at mcdonalds for a combo and this is way better if you are out and about for lunch i would highly recommend going here im sure most people have eaten here before so the food wont be a big surprise but the price is great this will definitely be a go to for me
__label__0 i dont often review places on yelp because of the time commitment and because usually i am just looking for a good bite to eat this time though i feel i should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place the food was decent and the atmosphere ok but seriously how can this place cost as much as it does 60 for two people eating light and how are people fawning all over it i dont like to complain about a good meal and indeed this meal was good but i cant seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place i have tried in phoenix that would be considered in st francis class i ordered a hearts of romaine salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup i shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had i made them myself from ingredients at the public market indeed i have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price the service was good i will say and for that i would offer a higher rating but the general ambiance of pretension was more than i could justify again for a meal i feel like i have had 100 times before in the end i guess i would say if they would knock about 10 off of each plate and cut some of the pretentious attitude i would probably be offering a much better review i am not planning a return anytime soon
__label__1 this place is great the pizzas are single serving or post salad and some of the best pizza ive ever had salads are good and and service is excellent keep it simple stupid kiss
__label__1 even though i am officially in my 30s i look like im still in college which made me feel slightly less uncomfortable when i walked into the clubhouse yes it is near asu and yes it is an allage venue so i should have expected that the club would be filled with 1820 somethings but just because i look 21 doesnt mean that my internal reality made me feel a little outofplace but i was like whateva it is somewhat of a dive bar trying to be a club but failing miserably like a nerd trying to be punk or a cheerleader trying to be emo it somehow didnt work for me it felt like i was in someones basement turned rockers haven black walls haphazard decor and one sole stinky quasicouch that looked like it had been salvaged from some dump the stage was at the front of the club and the bar in the middle dissected the under21 crowd from the over21 boozers unfortunately if you wanted to drink you had to stay on the over21 side of the bar that sucked because you barely had a view of the stage wtf shouldnt the paying lushes get a better view than the youngsters who only paid to get in the club stupid i have to say though the sound system was a helluva lot better than some of the other small music venues ive been to thats a plus finally this last annoyance will definitely show my age but having to stand the entire time i was there was horrible my feet hurt dammit and i just wanted to sit down but ill suck it up the next time because there are some great bands that play here and for me great music can make any situation better
__label__0 im usually a big fan of dive bars but wasnt impressed at all one of the kegs was empty so my friends didnt get their favorite beer not a huge deal but not a good thing for 5pm on a friday the servers seemed really overwhelmed and was probably due to the fact that there were only 4 for the entire place and it was really busy on a very positive note my friends said that the food was really good for bar food this might be a great place for any day and time other than happy hour on a friday
__label__1 yum yum yum i love oreganos pizza ive always loved oreganos but especially the last time i went there was a long line outside and the wait for us was 3045mins which i thought i was going to dreadbut the servers were really nice we were able to order drinks in the waiting area and they even came by us several times to give out pizza samples
__label__0 when i walked through the swinging doors around noon on a sunday i walked into hooterville think silicone fake tans bleached hair and teeth and cakedon makeup and the men here overdose on testosterone full of bulk and attitude think sideways baseball hats torn jeans flip flops and gold even at noon on a sunday they were on the hunt joining me in alienation was my sanfranciscan friend we represented the world of natural size and color to bring ourselves comfort and escape in this fake world surrounding us we discussed environmental concerns i got the buffalo chicken sandwich commensurate with the theme here this was the biggest breast id ever seen the sauce was super hot and tasty the baked beans had a southwestern flare with crushed pepper my friend got the chili which he said was slightly spicy hot but not temperaturehot i didnt attempt the bucking broncho for many reasons but one of them being that there was nothing on it to hold on to too difficult for a delicate northerner like me
__label__1 bookmans is great they probably dont need another positive review but so what i use bookmans for recycling books ive read and for buying used books for myself all i can say is that i like everything about the way they do business they have great people working there the store vibe is very positive their prices are very fair and what they pay for your used books is incredibly fair plus you know that youve made a positive contribution to our society by recycling books that others can enjoy do yourself a favor and stop in enjoy
__label__1 ive only hiked camelback once but i felt so accomplished albeit winded and mere minutes away from passing out we started the hike at 6 in the morning and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail i thought it wasnt going to be a bad hike but things get tougher about twothirds up things starting getting vertical at some points and i wasnt really prepared for that it was totally worth it once we got to the top though gorgeous 360 view of the phoenix metro area and really much more than that and watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too
__label__0 i love mexican food today i ate half of a taco and simply had to stop not in a good way either the meat tasted like it had been frozen multiple times and lacked flavor the tortilla tasted like it was store bought and made of paper the beans were flavorless the rice was hard and lacked any flavor moving to the vegetables shredded plastic is not actually a vegtable this is some of the worst tasting most over priced mexican food i had had it would be one thing if it was reasonably priced but 10 for taco is a absurd amount for a worst than fastfood taste the margarita was good but 10 for a margarita is a bit on the high side the service was average but i found it odd that my waitress didnt find it odd that only a bite of each item was missing and never asked how the food tasted
__label__1 ive gone back a few times since my last review every single experience has been fantastic the burgers are pretty good but do yourself a favor and get the pork tenderloin omfg sooooo freaken amazing also their onion rings are pretty much perfect and the fried cheese curdjust get it i was a little creeped out eating something called cheese curd but holy deliciousness
__label__0 terrible rolls the dragon was so so the california was bland and the spicy tuna was cat food seriously it looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible
__label__1 i want to preface this review by saying that im close friends with one of the sushi chefs in training so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat that being said i will review this strictly on the quality of food since we received some deep discounts due to being vip guests cmon now you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staffchefs so quit your whinin the quality of the fish was excellent some of the best sushi ive had in my existence the key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef and ask them what is fresh and what they would suggest omakase style we had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin yellow tail otoro yes the good stuff and a few other pieces served with fresh wasabi root not the hydrated green powdery stuff this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses we had a few different rolls per the chefs suggestion and all were spectacular including some off the menu rolls the kim bap roll was highly recommended and the quality was definitely memorable better than most koreanmom kim bop rolls ive had in my life we asked for amaebi sweet shrimp which was soft tender and sweet with perfectly fried shrimp head to back this was the first time ive had such perfectly made amaebi and its made me want to continue my search in chicago some tasty mochi desserts a few bottle of sake and all in all it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and i im sorry for those that have found a bad experience at otaku as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues but as a sushi fanatic my advice to you is this 1 dont ask for a table if youre party is smaller than 4 ask for a spot at the sushi counter because thats how sushi is meant to be served getting to know your chef the chef getting to know you having drinks together etc 2 ask the chef what heshe recommends not all fish are equally fresh and the chef will know whats best for the day and if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you likeddidnt like theyll likely craft a sushi experience for you that youll love verdict if only otaku were in chicago i might go broke delicious sushi and worth a visit
__label__0 i really wasnt impressed with the service or the food
__label__1 it looked like shrimp and it taste like shrimp but it wasnt shrimp it looked like chicken and it taste like chicken but it wasnt chicken it was all tofu and 100 vegan and it was all amazingly great even amys mock pork was surprisingly very pork like and i love pork you see i love meat and its very seldom that i go a day without meat in any given deal however this full mock meat experience was pretty cool and enlightening not only was the lil establishment very clean but the owner was super cool and informative although i dont see myself converting to full veganism anytime soon ill definitely be back to try a few more veganmock meat dishes boba juice is also my new go to place for a much needed icy cold smoothie with boba of course ive tried a few variations and my favorite is the tarococonut smoothie add boba i swung by boba three days in a row for a smoothie and thats a pretty solid indicator that i like the place yay i am a fan
__label__1 we popped in here for a brew while walking around heritage square the waitstaff is very friendly and attentive note if you just want a brew you can order it inside we went with a local hefe and it was great the options for noshing look great but we were headed for dinner so we didnt get a chance to try them out see you there soon
__label__1 i found this place when we needed a place to meet for a business lunch i had the smoked bbq chicken which was good but that seems to be all i get when i go ive tried some of the other dishes but havent really liked them my wife loves the fried pickles which im not a fan of the portions are huge but there does not seem to be anything special i can remember besides really large portions i suppose the biscuits topped with sugar smothered in honey butter are good but i also want to live to be at least 50 and they are not worth dying for as unimpressed as i am with the food the service is very good ive been there a few times now and have always been pleased with they way they treat us everything from the speed and attentiveness has been good
__label__1 i havent been here in quite a while but when i was coming here they had a jazz band doing rock and alternative covers their name is the latest though i dont think they play here anymore the place is totally trendy but i really see that as a good thing here
__label__0 i am a huge fan of chipotle but i will never come back to this location the staff looks miserable and are slow the cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean the rice was crunchy like it wasnt cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy never again
__label__1 love this place was in phoenix 3 weeks for work ate here 3 times the squid salad is amazing they also have sushi bibimbap and tons of other items must try
__label__1 intimate ambiance with good farm to table fare good presentation and wine pairings outdoor area is nice though as others have pointed out theres basically no lighting back to the parking lot after dark
__label__0 i brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this forever 21 location she had a bag full of goodies several hundreds of dollars worth from hm she stopped at forever 21 and sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes her hm bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her armsand while this certainly was not the responsibility of forever 21we were so disappointed in the way the forever 21 staff reacted they did not call security or the police or even offer any condolences they just shrugged their shoulders my sister in law did love some of the fashions at forever 21but the store was such a mess there were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack there were way too few staff members working and many who were working were socializing with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion the only employees that were on task were 1 at the checkout and 1 at the fitting rooms there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos including someone stealing bags from other customers so if you choose to shop at this store hold on to your bags

__label__1 uhoh where am i the view from atop the mountain is superb the city can be seen in all directions look theres downtown 1 and downtown 2 and a bunch of houses under construction and look at that sky wowza ok so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another dont worry i told my friend this city is laid out in a grid if anything we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street oh little did i know let me give you the back story ive been to south mountain twice the first time was christmas eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found i met a friend there and we blazed our own trail he always had his jeep in sight so no harm in getting turned around i trusted him to be my guide the second and last time i hiked south mountain was in february my best friend flew in to phoenix for the weekend for my birthday and since the weather was so great in comparison to detroit she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible no problem i knew where we could go for a good hike little did i know wed get lost we parked at the 24th st entrance and picked our path the mormon trail we were on our way to discovering religion we joked passing by several other hikers when we reached a recognizable summit we stopped to appreciate the view and then ponder our location should we turn around and go back the way we came were we still on the mormon trail where were the markers the loops the signs from god we looked at each other each of us having a takenoprisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock onward we shouted punching the air with our fists a little while later we were once again stopped our eye squinting against the retiring sun i wouldnt call us lost as this point in time but thats only because im too stubborn to admit such an error lets ask somebody i suggested so the next hiker dude that passed by we stopped to ask him will this trail loop back around where do you want to go he asked thats when i realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth i told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car yet about another mile or two to the 48th st entrance oh no problem i thought since the city was laid out like a grid little did i know there are exceptions to that we pressed on thanking our impromptu guide friend we hiked and hiked and hiked passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers finally the trail opened up to flat land we were close or so we thought when we reached the end of the trail there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go instead there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course wtf we set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit baseline in which we were determined to cut back westward and find my car the only way we had of getting anywhere the sun was setting we had no time to waste having hiked about 15 miles already our feet were heavy like cinder blocks but we continued on lets hitch a ride i suggested people were gathering in their wonderful ford pickup trucks and jeeps hikers are friendly i thought somebody was bound to accept our plea for help we opted to just do this ourselves thats when a car slowed down ugh creep i thought instead it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit he asked if we needed a ride my best friend and i exchanged glances i thought we can take him after a 70second long pause we accepted she hopped in back and i rode shot gun leaving my seatbelt off and the door unlocked in case of a speedy getaway we chit chatted on the drive down the road which lead to another road and then another and another until we finally touched baseline where the hell were we thats when it hit us we would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car all these windy disjointed roads damn golf course damn south mountain damn unmarked trails it should change its name to the moron trail for we just blazed it enthusiastically the kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away with a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline we unlocked my car got inside and drove away away from south mountain natures beast and practical joker we counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car another hour at least the sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement lucky for us we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment otherwise i may never have made it home to write this review
__label__1 this place is great if you are looking for something sweet and are in scottsdale i had the tin roof sundae and it was out of this world i love sweet and salty together sugar bowl is also open late so its a great place to go if you are hungry or drunk or have the muchies and need something good to eat the service however is a little slow and i would never dream of going during normal hours i have been late at night with the amount of kids that are probably there
__label__1 aka sketchy tempe with bonnie g part one of three i was in tempe i was having coffee i was sedate i wanted to see if anyone wanted join me and discuss kafka or something boring and so i called up the towns most famous resident to see what was goin down um you need to see sketchy tempe it is time and i will be the one who will show it to you meet me at time out lounge no wait meet me at monkey pants yes monkey pants and so i did monkey pants sorry folks but this name is nonsensically awesome i walked in and sat myself at the round bar joining a smattering of other patrons sitting there by themselves each staring into nowhere in particular well drinks for 250 served in a standard kitchen glass nice i proceeded to watch the football game and was soon joined by my tempe tour guide we were approached by the bartender to do discounted patron shotsbut only if we wore sombreros there was barely anyone here on a sunday night and im of the kind who doesnt care anyway and the thought of me and bonnie g sitting at a desolate stripmall bar with sombreros on is kind of ridiculous and great at the same time but shots were not on my agenda for the night alas i then got a royal tour of the place including the great leg lamp actually its two legs not just one shuffleboard pool tables couches with a cozy fire being played on endless loop on a big screen tv ample board games and another section with tables and chairs which is where we sat under the painting of the teddy bear in richard simmons gear other patrons were seated all over the large space so everyone had their own private area in a way i actually really dug this im not one who needs a place to be crowded to enjoy myself or feel like its happening sitting around a fake fire with pints and board games with a few friends is more my speed these days anyway so i may sound decrepit but im really not that old i swear sure monkey pants has fratparty gimmicks throughout the day but this place has no pretense whatsoever how can you even take it seriously even it doesnt take itself seriously i mean its just sitting there in a strip mall in tempe with a painting of a teddy bear wearing richard simmons workout gear on the wall and a stack of sombreros sitting next to a popcorn machine waiting for you to leave your critical mind behind and enjoy the now and enjoy the now we did all thanks to my sketchy tempe tour guide 4 stars end of part one
__label__1 so very portlandia in its hipsterness and decor premium coffee roasted inhouse in the middle of the desert no less who would have thunk it baristas were profesh and friendly they even warmed up our pastries upon request perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso i hope this place has a long life in scottsdale where great coffee is few and far between
__label__1 i hate having to give out three star reviews for me 1star isnt the worst possible rating you can an establishment a 3 is because 3 stars means it invoked no reaction to you neither joy or disgust no pleasure or pain id rather eat at a really shitty place that ill remember than a soso eatery that ill forget the moment i get back into my truck if i want mediocre take it or leave it food ill just cook for myself kthxbye as bfefs best frienemies forever clarice w and i frequently have lunch together in the peoria area the decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria where havent we been that we can yelp about our last lunch involved us going to hope kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work so we needed somewhere relatively closer with no hello kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back clarice suggested casa filipina a filipino place by the lennys burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th avenue we were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window we were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter i would come later to know as that fucking guy at first i was a little troubled reading the menu i was once in a relationship with a filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when i seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought but man i love her mothers cooking but aside from the adobo and lumpia i saw nothing else on the menu that i could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners i cant tell if this means theres more to the cuisine than im aware of or that said exs mother was as well as a good cook a fucking liar either way im glad i left her in the end anyway i ordered the dinguan which translates as chocolate pork dont be fooled by the name all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that iron chef america where they made savory dishes with chocolate chocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pigs blood ill repeat that its pigs blood its called chocolate pork because the blood takes on a brownishblack hue after its been cooked after hearing this from that fucking guy clarice changed her original order we even order the same thing arent we just the cutest to the bistek tagalog which she was familiar with and knew she would like all the entries come with at cfb is a side of ride im not sure if its jasmine white or saffron because i always opt for noodles when given the option and if you get that fucking guy that rice doesnt even come with soy sauce after serving us he disappeared into the bakery talking it up with some of the other customers clarice didnt get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice thankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and i was able to dribble it on my rice thats right muchachos we trannies prefer blood on our rice you think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use amigo i couldnt taste the pork all i tasted was the blood they couldve just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day the texture was nice though clarice wasnt as fortunate with her dish while ive tried to stay away from beef its enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits i had some of the bistek and it was passable it reminded me of beef jerky with its dry spicy roughness good but not sure if thats how its meant to taste moral of the story clarices entree did not make its own gravy which made eating her rice a little inconvenient and seriously just rice really good rice but seriously how hard is it to make good rice even my neighborhood sopooritstealsitsrecipesfromotherrestaurants chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal as the place is so fucking proud of its desserts we ordered some clarice got the creme brulee and i got the mango tart that fucking guy was in the middle of bringing clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in in the meantime i managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart burnt earwax my tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply clarices creme brulee was good albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon on our way out i learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit after i imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin i got an eclair to go what i got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rockhard pastry that youd get at frys essentially a diabetes sandwich casa filipina isnt good but its not bad thats the proble
__label__1 outback is a great restaurant you can count on the tasty food and good service they are reasonably priced and consistently deliver a quality product this location gets busy during dinner time but ive always had a good experience
__label__1 this place far exceeded my expectations and is far better than staying at a hilton garden inn or hampton inn this place is quiet clean and for the money you cant beat this place it includes a hot breakfast each day which means real eggs and hash browns served to you at a sit down cafe this alone saves about 10 per person per day while traveling this place has three pools nice if you dont want to hang out near the bar basketball court laundry facilities restaurant plenty of parking free wifi full kitchen great housekeeping service they cleaned our dirty dishes and a very courteous front desk staff the only downsides were the dim lighting and not enough wastebaskets or tissue boxes but for the peace and quiet ill take that tradeoff anyday this place would be excellent for hosting reunions because of the pools basketball courts and several sets of bbqs on central courtyards if you are looking for a fancy place this isnt it but it is an incredible bargain comfortable and very quiet
__label__1 typical dumpy yet fairly clean little sports bar in a strip mall setting get your tires changed next door at discount tire and grab a few heinekins while you wait beware though they call it coppers because it is owned and frequented by cops and for some reason there are a lot of people missing limbs that frequent the place hum ho
__label__1 unpretentious in scottsdale there are only a couple of places that can achieve this in my book and mabels is one of them i had been wanting to go here but just never got around to it so when a friend was in town for work midweek we went to mabels for a drink on a wednesday evening the place was pretty empty but the drinks were good and the staff was nice the atmsophere is very swanky with plush furniture picturespaintings of naked women on the walls and ads for mad men i would love to go back on a hot night to check out the food and the crowd
__label__1 3 stars only because the house margarita and guacamole was so good the food was decent fish tacos however the patio atmosphere was a bit sad i understand this is more of a bar than a fine dining restaurant but the patio tables had no place settings condiments etc just cheap metal tables and chairs also there was no music out there just this incessant humming of a back alley generator the service was a bit sporadic out on the patio as well we were asked by three different servers if we have a server yet not much in the way of organization maybe management just hasnt gotten around to fully organizing and furnishing the patio yet i hope they do because they are in a great location and the food and drinks give them lots of potential
__label__1 i have not been to the outback in years as past visits have well sucked i am not one to complain i just never go back if i have a bad experience or two seriously there are too many good places to go out to eat to return to business who dont focus on their food so my boss loves this place and she wanted to go and of course as she is the boss i agreed to return to the outback with her i have to admit this place has changed our server bree was excellent a server can make or break your meal and bree was on her game the food was really good ok i am super picky and was ready to hate it as i have in the past but tonight was different i ordered the teriaki marinated sirloin it came perfectly cooked at medium with sweet potato salad and bread all for 1295 maybe i got lucky and came here on a good night but i am glad i did and will definitely return
__label__1 in the mood for a little snack this is the place dont remember what i ordered my indian friend helped me but it was good and also try desserts
__label__1 tried going there for my 1st visit and they were closed during hours they were supposed to be open have tried calling them a few times during normal business hours and did not get anyone to pickup they may be closed for good not sure
__label__1 i have been to fez twice now when passing through phoenix first the decor is amazing an oasis of urbanity amid the heat and sprawl of phoenix excellent lighting and decoration and i love the food a mix of mediterranean and american fare this last time i had a grilledchicken sandwich with pomegranate vinaigrette goat cheese sliced pears dried cherries and field greens on ciabatta my dinner companions had different sandwiches and all were good but one of my companions said he thought his sandwich was just a tad oversauced the sweetpotato fries were a real treat i plan to make fez a regular stop when i travel through phoenix again
__label__1 mesa amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the phoenix area you can see and hear from anywhere in the place and the grassy risers were such a good idea the sound was excellent for the two shows ive been to there really just an overall nice peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the arizona weather parking isnt too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags to top it all of getting out of there was a breeze both times i was there
__label__1 a very nice pizza i havent made up my mind which is more authentic nypd or rays both have the thin ny style crust but nypd makes me feel like im waiting for an e train to queens whereas rays feels more upper east sideish
__label__1 it has been awhile since i have visited the dubliner the only reason i havent frequented the place lately is because i dont live near them anymore so i cant just either walk home or call a cab for 5 min ride however there drinks are strong and cheap either that or the bartender was being very friendly on the few times i have visited the food is not to shabby either i mean you cant possibly mess up fish and chips hmm fish and chips so go check it out but remember if you have too many call a cab did i mention that their drinks are strong and cheap winwin
__label__1 so wifey and i decided to check this place out for our monthly date night its a cool little spot around 12th st and oak in the middle of a neighborhood the decor is very modern but warm and inviting we opted to get an appetizer and a few of the small plates rather than the larger plates they had they had a balanced but approachable wine list i had an awesome tempranillo for under 10 bucks a glass we opted for the crispy shrimp and okra for the appetizer which came with this spicy banana sauce and this cool yogurt sauce i really really liked this dish the okra was great and the shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked not sure about the banana sauce but overall a great dish we then decided to get the stuffed dates with crispy schreiners chorizo and manchego it came with dressed spinach prob one of my fave dishes in phoenix right now we also ordered the macaroni and cheese and i forgot to mention the toasted bread and roasted garlic we ordered the bread and garlic was just okay nothing special i surprisingly was not a fan of the mac and cheese either it seemed very grainy i know it was chock full of parmesan so thats probably what it was but it was just unappealing to me overall this place has potential ill definitely go back especially because we got out with 3 glasses of wine and 4 small dishes with tax and tip for under 7000
__label__1 beautiful little gem of a restaurant great outdoor seating amazingtruly amazing mussels wholeheartedly recommend perfect date night too
__label__1 they say you never forget your first well postino central was my first postino and i remember my first sip and bite like it was yesterday the atmosphere here is very sexy at night candlelight and sexy music add to the already chic ambience postino has the food bliss i can still remember how the creamy ricotta and sweet figs on my bruschetta tantalized my tongue that first night i can feel the velvety red wine at the back of my mouth and drizzling down my throat parking is a bit of a hassle but they have valet for a reason if youre stuck waiting for a table squeeze in at the bar and grab a glass of wine or three people watching is almost as fun here as eating now that there is a postino in the east valley i am hoping postino central will get a little less busy if only to serve my selfish purposes i love everything about this place and i hope to be back soon
__label__0 had dinner there the other day again i love the design and atmosphere service was good but the food not worth the they are asking for starting with the kids option i ordered the pasta with marinara sauce which the server told me will have short noodles for easy pick up by a small toddler it was made of long wide noddle even after cutting it was not fit for a child i ordered the grilled cheese which was okay really not tasty as it should be my friend and i shared the rock shrimp which was awful tasteless and the shrimp was not cleaned through so we had some crunchy sand like experience then we shared the corn flat bread which looked and tasted like airport food we decided to leave and got our check for what we got paying that much was a big disappointment they didnt even take the kid pasta dish off 5 people really i will not go back unless it is for drinks only the two stars rating is for design location and an okay service food deserve one
__label__1 good flavors fast service love their green curry great happy hour where appetizers are 12 off the reg price the downside is that most of the appetizers are deep fried i like lunch better than dinner as they offer a nice salad with the meal
__label__1 i will preface this by saying that i went here a couple years ago for lunch and thought it was very good which gave it an extra star over my true opinion of my dinner there last night the bf and i went here before seeing louis ck for our anniversary we were seated right away so that was nice but it was like 545 so that isnt too shocking we sat outside which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees the waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app the menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze which sounded wonderful we were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order so we wait and wait and wait and i swear it felt like it was a half hour but it was probably more like 1015 minutes later we were super hungry the waiter came back to take our pizza order we ordered the la noce and he left well we waited some more finally got our burrata and it was a mess two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing not vinegar because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar surrounded by bread and prosciutto it was large so ill give them that but too large in my opinion because there isnt enough bread for the toppings the burrata was good creamy but it didnt taste like balsamic at all which was the most appealing part of the app the prosciutto was alright it didnt have a ton of flavor but it was fine the bread had a burnt flavor not my fave then we wait about 20 minutes waiter did not check on us finally get the pizza the pizza was good that was the redeeming item of the night it had arugula walnut ricotta and mozz it was a tasty combination now the whole time we were there there was a table of about 68 extremely loud drunk possibly old sorority girls sitting near us all we could hear is their conversation so much so that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity which obviously puts a damper on the experience the waiter was so occupied with them that we felt forgotten about all night he was not attentive he did not ask how things were and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 68 ways when the menu says they dont do that hmmm we sat down at 545 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show we were walking so the experience wasnt a good one but i would be willing to try it again as i did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago
__label__1 just the basics nothing fancy here but you can get a pedicure with hot stone massage for 18
__label__1 great mompop store weve stopped by several times for some fresh produce and to get treats for the kids we usually sit outside on one of tha picnic tables to eat gelato while the kids love playingpetting all the animals thanks
__label__1 love sams club especially those little red velvet cupcakes and chocolate wine the best we always do most of our grocery shopping here always a treat
__label__1 excellent customer service even with happy hour in full swing and the place full of parched winkies the service at our large table was spot on we barely had time to settle our bums and push the silver out to claim our table territory before iced h20 was before us our drink orders were taken and one quick blink of the eye and the peacemakers were before us now thats what i call happy hour bravo thirsty lion
__label__0 so not following my own advice ahem never return i returned here for a friends birthday dinner a few months ago i super love this person so how could i say no ha big mistake also fair warning there are severalacapslock ahead the only pleasant thing about the evening was the reservation and seating were right on time for our large group 15 people and of course because we were celebrating a super special person ill keep this update short and sweet 3 for a can of soda get real i knew itd be overpriced but i was at least expecting a mini bottle or something but a can come on you bought that in bulk and paid 03342 cents for it fail your servers idiots first it takes our server 15 minutes to come around the first time and take drink orders then shes back another 15 minutes after that taking the orders again did you forget were you not paying attention the first time we around why did it take 30 minutes just to order drinks and on top of that we wait another 15 to receive them fortyfive minutes to receive drinks is bad very very bad also not taking food orders until after weve been seated for one hour is bad very very bad seated at 8 oclock we didnt receive our food until almost ten oclock two hours for food is very very bad do you hear that st francis bad because i loathed the place even before this lovely birthday dinner and because the thought of supporting such an establishment makes my blood boil i ordered only dessert and the hubs ordered an appetizer and add on a 3 can soda funny that our bill was still nearly 30 for the both of us excluding tip bad also server if you say youre not going to split a check stick to your word or dont even try now im glad you didnt stick to your stingy i dont split checks because i could foresee the mess of trying to split a 700 bill with 13 people i didnt know so well lucky for us when we told you we were leaving early and asked for our check you split it for us a couple others caught on and did the same but the remaining 78 people were not so lucky because i realize my short and sweet is not so short anymore or sweet for that matter im ending it here note to self heed own advice and stay away from st francis
__label__1 still love their product but their online ordering process just doesnt work first time my order was sent to the wrong market second time i was shorted a package of chops i checked the bag before i left the market so it was only a minor inconvenience third time i ordered bacon which was listed as available on the web site and then contacted and advised it was not and may not be available for a few weeks since i paid upon ordering i had to go through the hassle of waiting for a refund ive also noticed inconsistency in portion size which is a problem considering you pay by product rather than pound boneless chops should be roughly 6oz each yet ive received 4oz chops at times resulting in 50 less product for the same price not a deal breaker for me but something to consider i continue to purchase from these guys regularly but no longer try to order ahead and i do wish they would have bacon available more often
__label__1 great restaurant i had the brisket sandwich and loved it they bring out fresh cornbread before the meal which is a bonus and small little donuts for after the meal the restaurant has a great decor and is a very pleasant atmosphere if you want some good ol fashion barbecue try this place out you wont be let down
__label__1 decent farmers market with several friendly vendors look for the jalopeno peanut brittle the incredible maccaroons sweet republic ice cream and crepes from torched goodness lots of yumminess and it is dogfriendly
__label__0 after bad experience i will never return it is terrible since they didnt meet my expectation and the price is outrageous the most difficult part of the pho is the broth req 16 hours of preparation and it tasted like water i had to add all kind of condiments to rescue it but cant even eat it the restaurant is very slow now and it confirmed what i meant with asian restaurant if your fellow asians dont patronize the place it is because your food did not meet our expectation try across the street to the rice plate kim thanh for their rice dish it is night and day
__label__1 second visit to ll the first was at lunch with a group of moms second with my family the service was excellent which is saying a lot they didnt have to ask what we needed they surveyed the table and kept the meal moving which i appreciated since we had the three kids with us this is not traditional chinese so get the asian nachos they are a giant appetizer very unique and quite tasty everyone enjoyed their meals and the happy hour deals are pretty good i see more visits in my future
__label__1 bacado yes you read that correctly the bacado it is a glorious concoction consisting of an avocado and bacon omelette with cheese on top and served with an english muffin and country fried potatoes decent black coffee and good service delicious
__label__0 maybe it was an off night it happens to the best of us ive hung out at az88 before several times but on the night i plan to review the place they were so off az88 buffalo ck sandwich ill eat one or two buffalo ck wing but to make it a sandwich i cant recommend too much sauce also make sure you chew fast because after a while the buns begin to go soggy umm mushy bread with ck cover in buffalo sauce toast the ck itll dry some of sauce and give a crispier texture service was off too i had 1 beer and 2 waters thats all if you know me i like a few bottles and at least a jug of water with my meal i know i cant get enough h2o i understand the place is popping but after being seated there was almost no direction for the wait staff ambience is always cool and love the layout and the feel of the place better luck next time enjoy
__label__1 great happy hour get the taco basket thursdaymexican beer 3
__label__1 i was blown away at the sheer number of books and magazines then when i looked at the prices that was even better there were books i found that were brand new and had no markings or tears and they were still at halfprice not to mention if youre nerdy like me it has the old book smell throughout the store reminds me of a rainy day in the library my only complaint is the grumpy employees i get it your job might be boring but at least smile and return the hello as for their product knowledge where everything is located etc i cannot complain i will be back again and again lets just say books are an addiction of mine and i dont want help quitting
__label__1 i second sarahs review try the 49er flapjacks and rons special southwest eggs they come with nearly diaphanous potato pancakes dont forget to hit the atm theres a wells fargo at 68th and camelback
__label__1 for my first time it was pretty decent just as everyone said it is pretty pricey i had the taco plate which consists of two tacos seasoned rice refried beans my bill was 1157 for that pretty steep considering that usually runs 7 most places but i can say 3 hours later i am still full as if i just left the table the chips salsa refried beans appetizer was a great start to meal as well my friends have already planned the next visit in which i will try the swirled strawberrymango margarita which is 24 oz for 699 sounds like a steal i hope the flavor is above the price
__label__0 weve eaten at arriba a few times now i really dont care for their food and service is slow more often than not the first time we went we were there it took a good two hours and thats not because were slow eaters we did stop in for happy hour last week though and although their margaritas arent the greatest theyre decent enough they ofter a 12 oz house margarita for 99 or a 24 oz grande for 499 why people would pay five times as much for a marg twice the size i dont know we each had three 99 margs ate the chips salsa and bean dip and our bill came to 594 6 and i left with a full stomach and a buzz nice
__label__0 should be called the bad egg bottom line the hotels free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there we arrived around 945am on a sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated the staff was pleasant enough we were seated given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special loaded potato skillet we sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again she finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee we finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor our food arrived about ten minutes after that the skillet was supposed to contain sausage bacon onion scrambled eggs grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream mine had no bacon two tiny chunks of sausage no cheese and the potatoes were so soggy they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought it was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce the waitress never checked on us once during the meal she came back by the time my husband was finished i told her the meal was horrible in a nice way she offered me something else by that point i was not feeling like eating anything else i felt kinda sick my meal was comped and we did get an apology the manager explained that everyone loves that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled the cook obviously didnt try my potatoes blech even with the comp the total was over 15 for one special and two coffees very hight priced for nasty food poor service and louduninspiring atmosphere
__label__1 always clean and accommodating to any workout schedule i work near by so it is very convenient to go at lunch great amenities even a pool and classes wish there were a few more yoga classes or classes geared to those of us that are out of shapebeginners but ill get there
__label__1 golden panda has a special place in my heart the part i clog with orange chicken im sure its not the most authentic chinese meal although i dont know but i consider it the best chinese take out in the area solely based on this one item although i get the same thing every time i have on occasion tried other items that people with me have ordered all the chicken entries are good the same lightly fried chicken just different sauces general tso is my 2nd favorite the beef dishes are terrible the seafood is just ok the won ton soup is really good as well and is usually the second thing i will order if orange chicken isnt enough i cant remember if the pork is any good but the won ton soup has pork in it so i would give it a shot if you like pork far more than chicken the owners and servers are a bit jaded by the high school students that frequent the place during lunch but will warm up quickly if you go in there a few times food comes fast by the way so make sure that when you get take out that you let them know if you will take more than 5 minutes otherwise it will be done and waiting for you after 5 minutes the store has few tables where you can eat but for the most part is a takeoutdelivery based establishment however if you do eat there they have barqs red cream soda on their fountain
__label__1 my dentist recommended this place to me five years ago and every since then i keep a keen ear to any of her recommendations as shimagamo is the best sushi ive had anywhere ive had sushi in ca ny tx and hi the fish tastes fresh and the portions are generous one piece of advice is to eat at the sushi bar rather than one of the booths assuming you are having sushi in my experience sushi tastes better served as soon as each sushi piece prep is done rather than waiting for the entire sushi order to be completed this place has the best unagi and an awesome escolar which i havent found anywhere else the suprise crazy roll served with a sweet wasabi sauce is always on our sushi order the only con is that this place is pricey but they do have a daily 57 happy hour that contains some great options however the best stuff is usually not on the happy hour menu also this isnt a place to have sake bombs its a very low key atmosphere for those just looking for an excellent meal youll likely notice early on how many folks are regulars i was told this was the spot where many japanese baseball players come to have their sushi the restaurant is very nondescript it sits in a corner of a shopping mall and is easily overshadowed by its neighbor cfu gourmet
__label__1 this place is old but the food is good the compliments arent that greatsuch as the basil and bean sprouts they give out their soy milk is made fresh and does not come from a yeos can
__label__0 the staff at this location was rude and unfriendly also the store itself was not the cleanest i have seen
__label__1 very good battered dipped fish cole slaw bland fries came barely warm service is fast for crowd very nice and friendly staff ill go back for the fried cod did have to exchange coffee cup it had some funk dried and stuck to the inside wall
__label__1 i came here with me sister cher who really likes this place im so used to food being prepared by cooks and brought to me so im not used to having to prepare my own food via restaurant i love to cook from recipes so why should this be any different right as we arrived there wasnt that many people i was relieved and allowed me to ask my sister 101 questions about what to do i ended up making a concoction of beef carrots broccoli rice noodles sprouts with chefs favorite sauce it turned out good but i know that i was missing something i tried some of my sisters bowl and that was really good so this place is a buildyourown bowl piled high if necessary and watch it cook right in front of you it was a little overwhelming at first but if i continue to go there i will get accustomed to the process
__label__1 have you ever tried the chicken rotisserie here they go fast so you have to be lucky to get one unless you call ahead its not so much about the rotisserie chicken as it is about the amazing and creamy and smooth and exceptionally well balanced garlic saucespread they give you that goes along with the chicken have i told you how amazing this spread is if only i knew the recipei would eat it by the tubokay maybe by the spoonfuls anywaytry the chicken rotisserie or the chicken taook heck if you dont want to eat either of those thingsjust ask for some garlic sauce on the side with whatever you are eating you will not be disappointed
__label__1 if youre in the mood for a foodie adventure ive got just the thing a trip to the caribbean head on over to tempe and enter a taste of the caribbean restaurant the bright yellow and green walls red floor and outdoor furniture will make you feel like youve arrived its kind of scruffy and laid back this is not the place to come for a quick bite first of all you have to make the tough decision about what to order oxtails or goat jerk chicken of course or do you want the milder brown stew chicken fish theres snapper tilapia and shrimp the menu is divided up into caribbean favorites friday and saturday menu lunch specials rice bowl specials and plate specials if all this has your head spinning youre not alone our server part of the family who own and run the place seemed equally confused but she was charming just accept it and the slow service as part of the experience dont worry be happy we ordered oxtails 1195 and eggplant curry shrimp 995 the oxtails in a brown sauce were falloffthebone tender fatty as oxtails are and totally delicious the accompanying plantains were caramelized and a little crunchy perfection a huge mound of rice and peas filled the center of the plate moist and beautifully seasoned and finally a side of cabbage there must have been a little sugar in the cooking pan because it was sinfully delicious served on the side was a basket of roti a homemade flatbread similar to a flour tortilla but much softer it was so hot we burned our fingers trying to pull off a piece we had finished off the oxtails when the eggplant dish arrived they were supposed to have come out together its a good thing we like to share be forewarned this curry is not for the faintofmouth i wasnt expecting the degree of heat my nose started running and my eyes watered but it was pure bliss with flavor layered on flavor the shrimp were perfectly cooked although i wouldnt have minded a few more and the eggplant was so tender it was almost melting into the gravy there were also some pieces of potato which had not been mentioned on the menu hiding in there the heap of rice and peas helped mitigate some of the heat as you might have gathered between the roti the plantains the rice and peasand the potatoes this is a carblovers paradise two odd things a wide variety of caribbean sodas are sold here but no ice tea and the rest rooms are in a different building than the restaurant the only disappointment was dessert i got a pineapple tart to take home i couldnt have eaten another carb if my life depended on it our server had said it was the best of the two desserts available uhoh the tart was really bad a smidgen of decent pineapple filling wedged between layers of leaden dough tough and greasy i was glad i hadnt eaten it at the restaurant because it would have put a bad ending onto an otherwise extraordinary meal
__label__1 this place is sweet i highly recommend it when you walk in the door be sure to look down at the floor because youre standing on a fish tank pretty cool the decor is very trendy and the atmosphere is chill we had a drink at the bar on a weds night before heading out to the patio for dinner not overly crowded which was nice the sushi was delicious quality pieces and very fresh my only complaint was the bathroom sink while very cool looking the faucets dont work unless you slam the handle in and then the water just sprays out sporadically this was a little messy but the rest of the experience was great
__label__1 if youre looking for a lunch saladsandwich this place is great not too busy but thats good because its very quaint the roost beef and bluecheese sandwich will fill your stomach and the cookie side is a nice treat
__label__1 very good place for breakfast and their pies are to die for weve been here about five times and they never seem to be crowded which is a shame their staff is always friendly and the food is always good its like a dennystype place but i think the food tastes better ive honestly never had a lunch or dinner item but i dont think thats what you go here for the prices are very reasonable once again pies are to die for weve had their strawberry pie x2 pumpkin pie peanut butter chocolate pie and most recently their mixed berry pie were going to be moving across the valley and im actually a little upset this location wont be coming with us
__label__0 blah is really all i can think of blah blah blah everything tasted the same everything i got an open chicken burrito which is basically a burrito in a bowl opened it had chicken rice cheese peppers onions and the shell i ate a piece of chicken tasted like the grill i ate some rice tasted like the burnt grill i ate an onion tasted like the grill i are a pepper tasted like the grill i ate the cheese tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top yuck i ate about 4 forks full and was so disgusted i had to chuck it fail of an airport dinner to the max
__label__1 great place hard to see behind carls jr on southern ave but is worth finding
__label__1 this place has been here 7 years and we have never been are you kidding me the food is excellent the people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there which is most important i tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich yummy there are many choices for salad toppings there us nothing i like more than a huge fresh salad i chose to top my salad with avocado tomato bacon edemame feta cheese and whipped balsamic vinaigrette i really think this was the best salad i have ever had they make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing i chose the chicken pesto sandwich the combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl the sandwich was excellent my hubby ordered the cuban pork sandwich this is one huge sandwich it was difficult to get his mouth around it but once he did it was awesome typically we dont like coleslaw but it was really good especially combined with the tender pork we will return to the market bistro again and again loved it
__label__1 i found this place based on yelp reviews so i feel obligated to add one more 5 star review to the mix i needed to get a chain fixed on my bike and was not looking to spend a ton of money or hours trying to fix it myself so i stopped by and had them take a look at it they recommended a full tuneup to keep it in tip top shape and spent the time explaining and demonstrating why it is deserving of spending money beyond the chain repair i ended up passing but didnt feel like they were trying to take advantage of me since it was close to closing time i left the bike with them overnight and got a call late in the morning the next day for pickup it has been as good as new ever since having my fair share of riding in the valley of the sun im sure ill be back soon for some intertubes or a spare part for whatever craigslist bike i happen to be riding around at the time protip check out the unique bike artwork they have around the place also they have a small bmx track in their backyard you can ride around and do jumps on anytime
__label__1 we were gifted a groupon for fuego and had the pleasure of dining there on friday night we did not have a reservation which would have helped us sit outside but we were seated inside right away the host was very pleasant and welcoming much has already been praised about this little gem and i agree with all of the accolades regarding the atmosphere the service the foodit was all wonderful we had the fuego salad which was huge and lovely although i would have liked some diced onions on it maybe ill ask next time the tortilla soup husband raved about this the pulled pork with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and mapleglazed carrots and the pankobreaded chicken breast with creamed jalapeno corn and mapleglazed carrots in all it was delectable the entrees were succulent and nicely plated i particularly loved the creamed corn which was perfectly spicy and helped clear by sinuses i succumbed to a bad cold the next day so maybe i need some more the only thing i would not order again is the carrots i didnt feel these added anything to our dinners the maple taste was pretty subtle to the point of being nonexistent also i think that if youre going to put yourself out there as an upscale restaurant go the extra mile and use real carrots instead of the bagged baby carrots that you can find so readily on cafeteria lines it will look better our waiter forgot to charge us for the soup i pointed this out and he comped us anyway i will definitely continue to patronize an establishment that empowers its staff to make decisions like that without worrying that theyre going to get a dock in pay well be back probably first to try out the amazinglooking happy hour
__label__0 went here for dinner there were only about 6 other people in there on a monday night even with 2 servers for 6 people the service was absolutely horrible we almost walked out after not getting service for about 10 minutes the food itself is decent bbq not great but entirely edible i enjoyed the blue cheese cole slaw when my dinner arrived the waiter said that they gave me the wrong type of sausage they left the one they gave me and followed it with what i ordered later which was nice the ribs come dry not wet but they will make them that way for you if you want with a crowd like this i dont know how much longer they can stay open
__label__1 dr natalie is a compassionate empathetic caring dc she listens takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better but to keep you feeling better her new location is adorable i highly recommend her
__label__1 better like it hotthese folks do not know the meaning of the word mild plentiful tasty mexican fare at a good pricealways a good bet
__label__1 best value for your money clean comfy beds quite great breakfast that is included
__label__1 they had me at bakedgoatcheese the appetizers were phenomenal we got the bake goat cheese that came with their freshly baked brick oven bread and my bf got the romaine salad with fuji apple bacon but the baked cheese was by far the better of the two main courses also didnt disappoint we ordered the white fish and hanger steak i only had a bite of the fish so i cant speak that much to it the bf enjoyed it it had too much lemon in the sauce for me but i hate lemon flavoring so its probably better to take his word for it the steak had this amazing sauce that accompanied it that added such a nice flavor to compliment the steak both entrees were pretty good size portions especially after appetizers and we also split a side of sweet corn polenta that we couldnt finish the actual restaurant its self is very open there is an outside covered patio and a smaller patio for the bar thats out in the open valet only complementary sat night wait time approx 20 mins clientele on sat night we had a big table of your typical scottsdale cougars average couples and groups ranging from mid 20s to 60s and a bachelorette party of 4 girls who were barely 21 not the typical place for a bachelorette party
__label__0 so i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place i would support the first amendment with my wallet unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least we came in on a 3pm on saturday and there was only one other couple inside we were literally outnumbered by the people working there i say this because somehow despite this fact the service was horrendous i mean we got our order out fine but our waitress dissappeared after that at one point i had to almost get refills for us myself the sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was the philadelphia roll was decent but the california roll was really bad when it came to paying i put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table the waitress didnt return if it wasnt for the cash i had on me id be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and i have no intention of ingesting there food ever again
__label__1 i really like this place i was surprised to see the other rating with one star i have been 3 times in the last 2 months always for lunch and ordered off the menu the restaurant itself is clean and neat and our food has always been fresh hot and yes simple but really good you dont feel overly full take the rest to go and its not greasy or heavy good stuff
__label__1 doc and edwards has been a place of refuge for 5 years for me hell most of my friends spent their 21st birthday there it is hard to explain walking into a bar and just feeling at home it is so comfortable and wide open even on the most crowded days i feel like i am on the cast of cheers the employees there are good and the food is exactly what you expect you can also order silvermine there with no delivery charge the pool table rates have gone up in the last few years but if you spend a good amount of money on drinks they waive the pool table fee or you could go for some ping pong foosball ufc or big buck hunting it has a great juke box but watch out for the lady that throws 20 in and slangs the worst playlist i have ever heard if my girl would only let me i would have my wedding there
__label__1 went there to photograph a concert great crowd and fun quirky locals loved the dive bar ambience without being trashydirty the lighting for the show wasnt great but the sound was good great beers too get the 99shillings
__label__1 i went here due to a restaurantcom coupon the menu was expensive which made me think that it was a fancy place but it turns out that the food was expensive because it was a restaurant inside a hotel it was inside the sheraton and i didnt see any signs outside indicating it was there wed made reservations since it was a friday night but they really werent necessary as there were only two other families in the restaurant wed dressed up we were the only ones the restaurant area was really very modern beautiful theyd made good use of lighting effects and there was a large full bar wrapped along the back portion we ordered the panseared cheese which were basically fried cheese poppers delicious but definitely overpriced considering only 4 of them came on a plate as an appetizer my date ordered the barons burger your basic burger and i ordered the valley of the sun ribs the ribs were a little dry but i really loved the arizona croquette that came with them it was fried crispy on the outside with creamy mashed potatoes on the inside with the restaurantcom coupon the meal was reasonably priced but without it i would have felt a little ripped off
__label__1 the restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere but i really love the food here ive eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout i love the gobi manchurian vegetable vindaloo and special vegetable curry i also like the weekend buffet its a great way to try several different things delicious
__label__1 went here before the jason mraz concert and the rock shrimp appetizer beers and cocktails were very good however the service was a little slow i ordered the angus cheeseburger and it came with a 1000 island dressing and pickles a glorified bigmac what a disappointment
__label__1 i met fellow yelpers brian s and shannon m here and learned that its all about the sandwich and feeling like you have walked on to a set for that 60s show or that 70s show its pretty clear the owners of casellas are focused on the sandwiches not updating the decor i had an italian beef sandwich it was great and i sat and soaked up the 70s decor as the bread from my sandwich was soaking up the juice this place is old school all the way old school awesome fing a now wheres my trans am
__label__0 this place loses out due to poor customer service which is a shame because the food is good it didnt used to always be this way it used to be good food with a friendly attentive staff but then they changed management our first experience with the new management and staff wasnt great service was slow but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide then we bought stuff from the market they have two registers sidebysideone for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills we went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal first of all we got ignored and had several customers taken before us despite the fact that we were there first when they finally decided to acknowledge us they told us we couldnt pay at that register since we had a market purchase rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there they made us wait in line again finally we checked outand were overcharged we didnt realize this until we got home and by then it wasnt worth going back we decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later this time the service was even more slow 15 minutes passed before we even got our water 45 minutes later our food still hadnt arrived the waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us we snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back and went to pay long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us and then they overcharged us again fortunately we caught it this time they hastily made the correction without so much as an apology rather they acted annoyed that we were holding them up how about getting it right the first time if you dont want to do it again so that was it i dont think well be going back its really a shame because the food is delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places its just a shame that the new staff sucks i can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged
__label__1 luckily ive only had to take my truck in for service once and had no issues with service or quality it is always expensive to have something auto related repairedwish i wouldve paid more attention during shop class in high school but oh welli cant be good at everything friendly staff they called a few times to make sure i wanted them to proceed with repairs and had my truck done in a few hours
__label__1 went there today for lunch for the first time and had the del reyes torta i was full after one half of this monster but was very good
__label__1 i liked this placeits a little dark i went in the middle of the day so there was probably more workers there than movie goers and the staff looked pretty bored actually 3 bucks aint bad for a movie i thought the place was clean and a decent selection of movies and refreshments i come from a small town so even this theatre is an upgrade for me for three dollars i will most definately be hitting this place more often
__label__1 gotta love sweet republic great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets ive loved every single flavor ive had there peanut butter brownie swirl mint chip salted butter caramel mayan chocolate and more everything is made from all natural fresh ingredients virginia peanuts fresh mint leaves etc when i really want to splurge i make my own sundae you get to pick two flavors of icecream a sauce and a topping if you havent been to sweet republic go if youre far from shea 101 find them at first fridays downtown farmers markets and more
__label__0 be very very careful asking for a sandwich as a wrap i ordered a ham and cheese make your own sandwich ordered it as a wrap to go i got home theres lettuce and mayo and what this whats this i see in this sandwich theres the cutoff fingertip of someones glove lodged between the lettuce at least i hope its the finger tip of a glove im not even going to think of the other thing it could have been ewwww gross i didnt finish the sandwich memo to self dont ever get wraps from einsteins particularly not the one on shea disgusting if it ever happens again im calling a local news station to report it then ill call the state health department gross gross gross gross gross gross if you cant deliver sanitary wraps then dont put them on the menu not a place to go if you like wraps
__label__1 their service was above acceptable but kind of slow it was wednesday night around 9pm and only one section in the restaurant was open for just a few groups their business looked very slow there but i suppose it was a probably typical week night situation
__label__0 im pretty sure these bagels have never seen boiling water and to be honest they reminded me of nothing so much as the tragic frozen failbagels of my childhood i guess our first warning should have been the exceptionally alarming cappuccino poster in the window showing what appeared to be coffee chocolate milkshakes with whipped cream and chocolate two stars because it was technically an edible bagel though my husband and i only managed to each finish half of ours
__label__1 i think there food is amazing however it is a bit pricey which limits my trips there i love the white decor but hate how expensive the drinks are i ordered a key lime martini and it was 1500 for one and served in a tiny little glass come on additionally last time i was there we went to the bar afterwards and most people were wearing flip flops which drives me nuts take a shower get dressed put some effort in save the flops for the pub hopefully it was just an off night because i really think it is a cool spot
__label__1 good place to kill an evening i used to spend my time here many moons ago good coffee at good prices
__label__1 im not a vegan or a vegetarian i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of mediumrare steak and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat because i think its just psychologically strange but ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago ive had nearly everything on the menu and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything my favorites number one absolutely has to be the mexicali burger i could eat these everyday it has the flamebroiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat but dont let it freak you out it also comes with hummus bright orange nacho cheese and chipotle sauce this burger is spiiiccyyyy so beware their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned also love their soy ice cream treats soynamis my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch their limeade lemonade and teas are always fresh and delicious i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicylovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant yummmm and tomatos their pita chips and hummus are to die for theyre crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head
__label__0 sorry im from southern california so im used to great mexican food we were excited to try this restaurant since we had read some great things about it however the waiter was pompous and the food was mediocre we were in a party of four and we all ordered different meals the guacamole that was made from one avocado was 11 the restaurant is in a scary location we had to park in a back alley it was agreed that the experience was a bust if youre in the area and want great food go to lons at the hermosa elements at sanctuary or true food kitchen
__label__1 sun up is my favorite craft brewery in az brewmaster uwe is german and brews creative quality american ales with a euro twist while there are regular beers the cask conditioned and strong ales change regularly recently they had 4 different kinds of ipa central phoenix highlight must visit order off of the chalk board seasonal ales are the highlight here
__label__1 home to the mariners and padres spring facilities peoria sports complex is a pretty great place to take in the action i have seen a decent number of games here over the years most recently i saw a weekend game sitting out on the lawn it does not get much better than relaxing on the lawn watching some baseball hanging out with your friends and getting some color in the 80 degree heat the practical details 1 there are a ton of food options maybe too many if you believe in such a thing food of all kinds is everywhere you can get all the standard ball park fare and some more exotic things too like noodle dishes sushi fry bread etc 2 ticket prices are good sit up close for 20 bucks on down to the lawn for 6 bucks you cant beat it for getting up close to the action 3 parking is only 5 bucks in the lot which i think is really decent but if you want to walk a little further you could find street parking across the street best deal in the park 9 for a 32oz soda with unlimited refills a large one is 5 and not as big so if you get even two this is a great deal on the hot day i was there we filled the sucker up three times and once more before we left well worth it in short if youre doing the spring training thing definitely come to peoria its super relaxed and one of the best places to enjoy some baseball you will want to keep coming back
__label__1 a handjob with gardening gloves i went looking for scottsdale auto salon to get a hand wash tint quote on my new mini today finding it out of business i whipped out my handydandy yelp iphone app looking for a nearby alternate to at least get the wash done and found classic car spa expecting to pay a bit more for a traditional hand wash i was surprised to find a machine assisted process id spent way to long trying to locate the place thank you google maps so i just opted for their supreme wash which includes both interior and exterior detail my son and i watched the car move through the process and saw that at least the wash part was done by hand but they used the same mitts from the filthy truck that had gone through previously 1 star after seeing this i should have watched their interior detail more closely when i got the car back there were lines of dirt in my white roof and water spots on the accent chrome when we got in the car there still bits of chip on the seat and floor mat from my sons spill the day and it was obvious that the dash and interior hadnt been detailed unless they refrain from using any product what so ever on the interior of the car the dash and steering wheel were bone dry and dusty 1 star i should have brought it up to someone but my husbands and sons hunger won over and we just left thankfully all of their other locations are to far out of the way to bother detouring to again the staff was friendly and their waiting area was pleasant with lots of drink choices although im not sure their waiting area was comfy enough for anything longer than a wash
__label__1 i came here for a yelp event and had a great time they have the place somewhat divided into two sections bar and restaurant i liked that the patio opens right into the bar so you kind of have an extended bar the food was really good and the staff rocked i have been meaning to go back ill put that on my todo list
__label__0 my friend and i have been going to camelback spa for about 5 years for our birthdays this past year we decided to try something new we went to desert ridge spa for a change of pace man were we ever sorry we did the facilites are not nearly as nice as camelback the food service sub par at best while they did make it right the fact that my friend ordered one thing and was given another and we complained to the waitress her response was oh i was curious at which one of you got the wrong order really you knew that and didnt come up to us i asked for my burger medium and it came well done i am glad i didnt wait for her to come back and ask how my food was cause it was 12 hour before she came back i was parched for some water although they gave us our food for free it was just inexcusable have had better massages at massage envy will not be going back
__label__1 this awesome park and recreation center makes me wish we lived in peoria we were here today for a frag reef tank geeks picnic and the whole area is new and beautiful with lots of different amenities we saw sand volleyball courts a spashground with critters spouting water for the little kids a skate park packed with older kids picnic ramadas fishing areas baseball fields batting cages and a duck pond there is even a starbucks we were at the group ramada bbq pavilion the likes of which i have never seen before it was a huge covered circle of about a dozen bbq grills with ventilation hoods hanging above and a cement bar from which to serve on the outside circle and smaller cement tables behind on which to do prep work there were also sinks in the center to wash up surrounding this circle of grills were corresponding ramadas with picnic tables numbered for your group what a fantastic set up great job peoria
__label__1 welcome to downtown finally a little area with a few great chains they also have parking the parking is located on the east or south side of the building we grabbed jersey mikes on a sunday afternoon and took it home to eat they are the best subs we have had they are packed with meat and cheese might be little pricier then blimpie but with it due to the over load of meat check out a jersey mikes near you
__label__1 being from nj i am always on the prowl for my hometown pizza and italian food they have absolutely the best cannolis like my grandmothers the pizza droops like rays pizza in ny im not a big fan of sauce that has any sugar in it which most do so to many their sauce is awesome i prefer unsweetened everything the service is great and they are from new jersey its a great place to grab their special 2 slices and a coke for 4 yum
__label__0 hellish hellish summer weather march thru october it hurts my lungs to breath i couldnt get transcripts because i had a parking ticket i needed to pay the problem is i dont own a car i dont drive i dont even have a drivers license aside from that one minor incident i paid 9000 usd a semester to receive a so and so education i graduated with a magna cum laude i have attended other universities however i couldnt help but notice the gap in the quality and variety of classes offered for example you have to be a finance major to take upper level interesting finance classes business school was so and so a lot of repetition very little handson and help with internships way too much groupwork and freeriding they do not have many good employers at their semi annual recruiting events oh and professors rarely teach the courses they have their teaching assistants teach us also there is a lack of bridging classes between lower level and upper level classes junior year when you get admitted into the professional program the level of the classes and transition isnt too smooth the campus tutoring program is pretty helpful for general classes if youre having trouble with classes usually lower level there are not enough chairsdesks in some classes the students sit on the floor and cram on the stairs in the lecture halls also the classes dont teach you how to think critically which i think is crucial in college please dont waste your money especially those of you from out of state its not worth it expect to wait in line wherever you go asu accepts way too many people it would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them thus its very difficult to get myself into the classes i need the advisors are walking advertisements of the business school they are not informed enough to advise you i got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so i could not move on to the next level even after preregistration i got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate tuition rose from 6000 a semester in fall of 2003 to 9000 in fall of 2007 gross one thing i liked was the student theatre performances the admission was reasonable and quite entertaining the college of architecture and environmental design studios are pretty good and has good security asu is not the most safe neighborhood i have been approached by many shady people do not live on campus especially the dorms on north campus they are beyond crappy and overpriced you have to split your room with a room mate in most cases for undergrads the freshman year experience bullsht they pull on you dont buy it and please please please dont move into manzy hall manzanita 15 stores with triangular windows i lived here my froshy year and its the dirtiest rats unhealthy mold pot circulation most promiscuous place on campus again please dont bother wasting your money especially if your an out of state or international student hope this helps
__label__1 one of my favorites the crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meatlettucecheese and always filling the prices are reasonable for what you get also like julios g too next door for quick take out or no tip casual meal self serve chips and mild chunky salsa are terrific
__label__1 their frozen drinks carried me through last summer they have free air for your tires and water for the radiator at every location ive ever been to their hot sandwiches though greasy arent too greasy and actually taste like food the coffee is pretty good and they have more ways to tart it up than starbucks does qt frickin rocks and btw the qt stands for quick trip
__label__1 awesome
__label__1 scratch is an adorable little pastry shop on the corner of miller and indian school from what i gather the owner is almost always in the shop behind the scenes creating the incredible dishes and pasteries i have come to love i have been to scratch about four times now and have never had a bad experience the place itself is rather small tucked away in a shopping center right next to a subway the home of the 5 footlong the decor is fresh and inviting from the pinkgrey walls to the framed magazine covers stylishly displayed along the walls the owners wife is the model in many of them but enough about the building and decor the food is by far the highlight of the experience as it should be i would recommend any of their sandwiches as the bread appears to be freshly baked daily with encrusted herbs each dish comes with a side salad with the most amazing tangy rich dressing i think i will have to purchase a bottle of the dressing next time im there i recently tried the asparagus soup which was deliciously creamy and rich the quiche i would also highly recommend ive ordered the lorraine as my entree on one occasion but have also sampled the spinach and goat cheese which was equally incredible each menu item is really reasonable i think 750 for soupsalad and 800900 for most sandwichsalad and quiche combos please no matter what you do even if you are so very full after eating a scrumptious lunch or dinner here you must try one of their pasteries even if taken to go i would highly recommend either the milk or dark chocolate tarte the fruit tarts also look amazing but i have had the hardest time trying anything but these amazing chocolate tarts they are well worth the 500
__label__1 a trendy looking barin the airport hmmm wait in the phoenix airport no way impossible not a chance these were all the things i assumed before i actually arrived at barfly before my flight to mexico a few weeks ago and i could not have been more wrong i wish i was there longer and actually had a chance to sample some of their offered dishes which honest to god sounded pretty decent its still the airport so plan on paying the awesome prices of 10 a beer etc but at least you can spend your preflight time drinking on a cozy leather couch watching tube rather than the alternative fox sports bar in every other terminal
__label__1 the best example north scottsdale has of traditional phoenix sonoran mexican food los olivos restaurants have been around forever at least since the 60s the food is great if not fancy and the place is pretty free of gimmicks you can get your fix of cheese crisps aka quesadillas for you ca transplants deep fried tacos chimichangas combination plates with so much sauce and cheese you cant tell whats underneath but it all works together to taste so good los olivos still plops down the free chips and salsa right when you sit down so youre good an full when that combo plate comes and glad for it the atmosphere is more like a nice mexican diner than mexican cantina and service is solid they often have mariachis playing on weekend nights margaritas arent great but the beer is cold dont bother with dessert cheap eats for all the food especially since you wont be hungry for another 24 hours if youre in north scottsdale and in the mood for traditional phoenix style mexican food los olivos is a great choice
__label__1 ive been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place since its on the way home from work i finally got the chance to stop by yesterday theyve been open about a week now they are located on the north west corner of guadalupe mcclintock between the pet food store and panda express super cute place has a roll upfold up door so the whole front of the building can be open right onto their little patio you can sit inside or outside tons of different flavors i tried the peanut butter jelly a mintchocolate one both were very tasty i ended up going with their chocolate yogurt with some peanut butter sauce a giradelli chocolate sauce and peanut butter cups so good a decent sized cup cost about 330 the girl who rang me up was super nice and offered me up little sample cups the only suggestion i have is to label the toppings yes most all of them are selfexplantory but a lot of those candy bars look the same all chopped up i will be back for sure
__label__1 they dont serve food they serve sex on a plate at first glance the place looks like a hallway but its really a flavor factory hidden away between two buildings no one cares about because those places dont have pastys the service is fast friendly and the music is off the chain the food is not to be forgotten though there are so many selections of pasty variations that anyone with any craving will loose all control of there facial expressions i only wish the place was bigger there have been times when ive had to wait for a space to open up but thats not necessarily a bad thing that time allowed me to prepare myself for the nirvana inducing flavorgasm that is the cornish pasty company
__label__1 food is great really good deal lots of tasty food for a great price my favorite combo is the pulled pork sandwich with side of mac cheese coleslaw kool aid founded by former nfl asu football player they know how to barbecue i truly recommend everyone trying it out the atmosphere is not that inviting yet the food is worth staying and will get you to come back i can guarantee
__label__1 this restaurant is truely cultural experience in your mouthchinese mexican with a dash of jamaican pollo diablo is fab mom and pop place with some true tlc that goes into the food the beer and wine was a good selection as well way to go
__label__1 i really adore this place theyve got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very very juicy i recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly last time i was in i noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the parkandride light rail station right in front of their restaurant do yourself the favor if youre heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike stop off here and enjoy a nice meal they have good lunch specials around 750 for a full plate with meat hummus garlic sauce pita and tabouli mmmm
__label__1 originally came by to get a watering system for our chickens and ended up buying something for every member of our furry family they have everything here for cats dogs small birds rabbits poultry horses and more the customer service was excellent we were even given free samples for our chickens without even asking and were given informational sheets about some awesome products we ended up buying as well both of the people working were concerned with taking their time to help us not about making a sale and will even special order some products for us if ever needed we dont feed our dogs dry food anymore they now eat raw instead but when we did these are the premiumhealthiest brands we were buying at a much higher cost at other retailers the prices are low the hours are convenient the customer service was great the products are healthy and the selection was large for how small the shop is what more could you ask for great first visit and we will definitely be coming back again
__label__1 can i review some of the people who go here because i know one idiot who would get 1 star but the park still gets a 5 one dude let his dog pee on me and the little bugger was fast hed prance toward you and before you knew it his leg was up and piss was streaming out of his winky cannon my friend was tinkled on multiple times she wasnt able to jump out of the way very quickly since she was pregnant did the man say anything only that his dog was only nervous are you kidding me alright i got your number in return we very actively encouraged our australian shepherd to play with the little terrier why because the aussie shep becomes a drool monster at the dog park and the little pissing terrier who only likes to pee on people not trees or anywhere else in the park ended up dripping the aussie sheps saliva sweet that was the only time we didnt feel guilty about her saliva marking other dogs
__label__1 i love this placetheir italian beef with hot peppers is a must i have also tried their sausage and pep sandwich which is just as goodtheir prices are as good as you can get so if youre hungry stop in get full
__label__1 best breakfeast downtown bar none its far more healthy than i traditionally prefer but the place is beatiful very cool and has an adorable waitress
__label__1 lets see 89 cents at taco bell for a taco that has cheese like sprinkles on a cupcake or a baja soft taco that has five pieces of tomato in it you must be joking compare your baja soft taco to the picture sometime and feel free to yell at the counterperson yes this happened taco bell should be sued for complete misprepresentation meanwhile at del taco 39 cents for a balanced taco with a decent amount of cheese and delicious medium scorcho sauce the choice is clear plus the deluxe tacos are chock full i usually get 4 regular tacos and end with 2 deluxe ones ive had the double cheeseburger once nothing impressive there it wants to be an in n out doubledouble but it falls short like when you were a kid and wanted levis 505s for christmas and end up getting sears jeans come for the cheap tacos and load up i say the burritos are ok too
__label__1 im addicted everyone there is so freakin nice and maui dogs are delicious
__label__1 best happy hour in north scottsdale get there early to beat the crowd amazing cuisine and atmosphere
__label__1 who doesnt love 3 well drinks relaxed social no frickin paid seating except that i was propositioned to swing by some totally gross dude i lovd this place to start the evenings great cheap drinks what more do you need
__label__1 love it awesome pulled pork brisket turkey the sides are really good too i feel like its somewhat expensive but its worth every bite but then again thats bbq if its dirt cheap that means its not quality meat anyway the 2pound potato is great too chives sour cream butter
__label__1 i love the pretzels wish they would bring back the asiago dip but hey garlic salt and cabs are 2 of my main food groups great atmosphere can always see a game on one of the many tvs even when my girlfriend thinks im paying attention to her milk stout is my favorite beer but the light isnt bad either something tells me the others are good too but its hard to get me to stray from my patterns oh well ill leave someone else to review those all in all the food and beer is great and the servers seem to know what theyre doing too
__label__1 love love love this place tasty with great prices who can beat that my newest thing is to order a gyrotogo and enjoy it at home im a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be haha see ya there
__label__1 first i want to thank hula for saving my date night we headed out for postino central for their wine and bruchetta special on a tuesday and were disappointed to find out there was an hour wait so we headed up central looking for an alternative i saw hula and remembered ive wanted to try it for while so thats where we ended up i started with a blood orange martini and sweet potato fries the martini was awesome but i have to say the fries had potential but they werent crispy for dinner i had the jamaican jerk tofu it was pretty flavorful and the corn cakes and plantains that came with it were a nice addition the meal was good the service was great and the overall ambiance was chill yet urbane it wasnt the best place ive ever been but ill definitely go back i love that there are several vegetarian options to choose from so im eager to see how the other entrees turn out with tofu
__label__1 amc esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new dinner and a movie blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate thats right i just referenced blue ocean strategy get over it no its not an extremely enlightened idea ive been sneaking bacardi into theaters since 2003 so its about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it but amc really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from them but also upgraded chairs and a ton of delicious food including the obligatory 4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a 9 burger like dont mind this 9 full meal over here we still stand firm that gummi bears are worth their weight in gold yes its more expensive than a regular ticket almost double for the nice seats but trust me you want those seats you will regret not getting the 15 seats if you dont buy the 15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home this theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable i saw the master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled bacardi flask if i didnt have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it i seriously wont go to a movie anywhere else and i guarantee youll say the same once you go five stars
__label__1 this is my goto spot for manipedis and brow waxing they do a bangup job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good i have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 35 minutes to be assigned a nail tech they recently got new massage chairs that dont grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do also this is one of the best places i have been for a brow wax my sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here i dont know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do oh and they are typically 5 cheaper than anywhere else i have been for pedicures
__label__1 dropped in today for the first timeand can i say its worth the drive no attitude no cnty saleswomen like that other place that shall not be mentioned cashier sales people and customers were all so darn friendly and helpful i dont know what to say other thanyay ill drive the 20 miles here to get my dog the food he needs buhbye local business pet store thats closer to me and sells the same brand of food i buy for my dogim a fan of the beast
__label__0 not exactly what i would call a great place to eat if you want to take your teenager out for a shake or ice cream you may enjoy it
__label__1 this place has the most amazing selection of cheeses ever boyfriend got me a tasting selection of about five different cheeses for my birthday last year and i was in heaven truly amazing variety and all were super yummy
__label__1 great white sangria and margaritas we went for dinner but ended up ordering appetizers and a pitcher of white sangria all i can say is the service was great but the drinks are amazing the tortilla chips were fresh and homemade the ceviche was so tasteful
__label__1 seriously the best 3am quesadilla i have ever had it was big and gooey with just enough browning on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little bit crisp as an added bonus it was kind of cold outside so it made a great hand warmer as well why only 3 stars ok you do have to sit on some questionable outside picnic tables and i dont want to think about how clean the kitchen may or may not be but the entertainment value of watching tipsy people stumble around while waiting for their food cant be beat
__label__1 in being a bit of a burrito man i was suspicious that a torta could ever marvel a tortilla filled with meat however all of the hype on yelp and man vs food was appropriate as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork turkey guacamole and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich the carne asada quesadilla blew us away huge in portion amazing meat and super flavorful i was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place people were friendly toward us in any case check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas
__label__1 best pizza ive had in arizona hands down my best friend lives in az my friends and i stopped by this place and enjoyed surprisingly wonderful tasting pizza a must try when i went here they were playing underground hiphop which i am a fan of it made it a great atmosphere to enjoy my food i highly recommend this place i live in california and this place still comes to mind great for college students and the fam bam
__label__1 last week was my third visit to noca since it was a thursday i had the wagyu pastrami sliders they were very good thick pieces of meat on nicely toasted bread house made chips were great on the side good service topquality restaurant all around
__label__1 this target gets the job done their shelves tend to be in a little disarray and their makeup selections are generally lacking but other than superfluous purchases i didnt even need to make this target has never let me down the grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store i love perusing these aisles their clothing section is pretty diverse but because the store is somewhat small its packed in tight its a challenge to maneuver the area the biggest perk is its central location to southern tempe its also very rarely busy during the day which is awesome
__label__1 best corned beef sandwich ive had anywhere at anytime definitely great portions of food the jewish sliders are very good especially with the potato pancakes too bad they arent in california because i can see myself visiting this a lot
__label__1 yum jersey mikes i freakin love their wheat bread with the little specks of i dont know what it is but its very good the mini sandwich looks tiny when you first see only the bread but after its decked out and rolled up it becomes a plentiful sized sandwich ive tried different sandwiches here turkey club both kinds italian and cheesesteak and love them all theres something about that oil and vinegar they top it off with in the end that seals the deal other places do that too but idk here it just tastes better sometimes i ask for the chipotle mayo instead of the regular and its quite yummy with a little added spice also i like that they carry pepsi products i like it better than coke and they have cherry pepsi too
__label__1 ok sweet pea and i love us some coup and its not just because weve been coming here for years since i lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window or because we got engaged here which was incredible its because the food never disappoints you can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible but coup is not the place for that its consistent and consistent can be good or bad as consistently good as the food is the service is likewise consistently slow albeit friendly we went here for valentines day which weve been several times and i highly recommend its romantic without being showy they have a special valentines day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good and if you go on the day before valentines day they still have the menu but its cheaper damn those greeting card holidays the menu is also consistent the outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute musttry as an appetizer and the lamb shank everything else is solidly good without being great the desserts are exceptional i like the byob aspect of the restaurant although they do charge you a lot for corking fees which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle coup i love you you get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little please please please get more vegetarian if any vegetarian options and improve your service
__label__1 went in on a friday at about nine for a quick bite to eat far underdressed but i was welcomed warmly looked for a seat in the bar but it was jam packed standing room only fortunately ran into some friends who let me sit at their table was greeted by a server after a few minutes and brought back drink and food menu ordered a la paloma ny strip medium and broccoli i was promptly brought my drink water and silverware after just the right time my food was brought to me i enjoyed my steak but my only negative was the plate it was brought on the plate was so hot the moment it was set in front of me i could feel the heat radiating off of it i did not enjoy eating my meal while sweating from the heat of the plate and being in fear of burning myself with any accidental touching of it not long after that some more friends showed up and we had a very nice 2005 napa cab i didnt browse their wine list but if i do go back i am curious to what they have overall it was a nice experience but im not sure ill be going back anytime soon
__label__1 had lunch here with robyn n and rand h the food here was ok and i liked it better before they did the so called renovationall they did was add a mongolian bbq and wash the windows some of my favorite things on the buffet were gone so i am dropping them down to 3 stars but still it was a good lunch
__label__1 i was quite pleased when i visited quick n clean today i opted for the 6 wash though now i cant quite remember what was included in said wash i felt like it could have been a little bit more thorough in the rinsedry section as there was a trail of dirt coming off the back of my car however be not dissuaded by the dirt on my bumper as i wiped it off and the rest of the car looked great because the vacuums at this place oh my gosh i have never been to this kind of car wash and experienced such suction they were also an ideal shape for getting into the tight spaces underneath my seats word to the wise when you go to remove the hoses from their little canisters pull with force i stood there for a couple of moments as i attempted to gingerly remove it and thought the hose was stuck i soon realized that i looked like an idiot and just gave the vacuum a tug and it came right out overall i definitely say thumbs up i had been hoping for a little rag to wipe out the interior but am not sure if the rag was part of one of the other packages so i will investigate again and let you know
__label__1 i really didnt think this place was all that great none of the food that i ate was particularly very good i think the best thing i had were some sort of sweet and sour meatball things everything was just hard overcooked or flavorless i wasnt really impressed with the options available either the saving grace of this place is the bbq station and the sushi bar the bbq looked 1000 times better than ycs mongolian freezedried junk the sushi was decent too this place is just middle of the road for me i cant blame it for having overcooked foodits a buffet but still ive had better
__label__1 i love this place i sit in the bar and as one other reviewer noted there is always someone interesting there to start up a conversation the burgers are top dawg the condiment bar allows me to fulfill my jalepeno quota the wings are perfection and the drinks are reasonable when the weather is nice grab a table outside the service is a smidge slower but the courtyard more than makes up for it if the weather is warm settle in and enjoy whatever game they have playing if you arent seeing your team just ask and they will happily turn at least one set for you
__label__1 ive gotten lunch take out here a few times the only thing ive tried is the drunken noodles while i think they are pretty decent i have been having serious issues getting the right spicynes the first time i got them i asked for level 3 spicy their spice meter goes from 05 i love love hot and spicy thai food however these noodles were practically inedible yet they were so delicious at the same time i devoured the entire thing and i felt like i was going to die later as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking the second time i ordered them i asked for level 2 spicy this time they were not spicy at all at all they were so bland i mean they still tasted good but were missing that drunken noodle kick so at this point i dont know what to do obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means the last time i ordered from here i simply said drunken noodles i didnt specify a spicy level i figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that i so desired well when i got them they were more bland than the level 2 and tasted kinda weird i will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work and i hope we can work out our spicy issues 4 stars for the service theyre really friendly here 2 stars for the food until we can work out our issues and 4 stars for the convenience
__label__0 i feel the days inn tempe is best described as a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile i booked my 10night stay on travelocity for a nonsmoking room yet when i entered the room i almost choked it was disgusting ive never had a smoking hotel room before and i will make sure i dont again they said they couldnt move us to a different room my local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew no big deal i thought to myself as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew nope coors light it is the towels felt like they were made of cow tongue and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about 500 im awarding one star in addition to the minimum onestar rating because i got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby the dollar store had a corkscrew
__label__1 the foods been covered before so all this review will be is further social proof that this place does indeed rock ive missed good veal cannelloni for a while now looks like i wont need to anymore for once its not the processed grey stuffing that has one texture throughout surrounded by an inner tube cough famous chain erins pollo piccata was excellent and the accompanying pasta was perfect sadly they fed me too well since i was dying to try the tiramisu but the afternoons plans didnt involve refrigeration lastly thanks to all that saw the excellent reviews and kept piling them on it really makes a big difference on how likely weve been to try new places
__label__1 ive been here a million times and usually have lunch at the bar this is the classic french brasserie style restaurant with a nod to balthazar restaurant in nys soho this is a fun place this visit i sat at the bar and had the curry chicken sandwich on toasted sourdough i think that toasting the bread on any sandwich makes it better the sweet curry flavor make this sandwich a winner sean may be the best bartender in scottsdale he is always friendly and very efficient definitely stop in here the next time youre at kierland commons
__label__1 i cannot believe i am about to say this airport food is good for any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis youve surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks it doesnt matter how much you spend the bread is stale or soggy meats are dry and tasteless and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality i was just shocked when i visited the roadhouse at sky harbor recently i had an hour before my flight so i ordered a stella artois and a french dip i wish id had a camera to catch my expression when i bit into my sandwich the bread was soft and warm the meat was tender and tasty the cheese was really good no joke this was real cheese and hot au jus omfg i almost freaked out it was so good i couldnt wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised i was she kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time at an airport folks this is the best kept secret at sky harbor i will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future even if my gate is in another termial this place is in the low b gates try it and you wont regret it
__label__1 i must be spoiled and realize that this is not a big grocery store i tend to think the store is a good place in a pinch for asian ingredients mostly chinese and vietnamese products for those looking for japanese products might have to go elsewhere in a pinch it is great hopefully with local support this store can improve
__label__1 awesome country club great new remodled gym heated olympic pool for year round use love the family like atmosphere plenty of planned family eventspool parties only complaint wish members who didnt pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis regardless courts are top notch great facilities and friendly staff
__label__1 you dont need no teeth to eat our meat haha what else needs to be said this place is a solid bbq joint im from the southeast and i love pork bbq i was raised on nc style from southern va but i appreciate all bbqs this place is pretty great its inexpensive decent customer service cheap beer very little fatgristle in the pulled pork which is something i pay very close attention to if youre looking for something quick easy inexpensive and delicious give this place a try
__label__1 you like hotdogs motor thats me says get in your mommys oldsmobuick and get over to teds and you sissys that like sonoran style dogs talking smack about teds go back to tucson and eat your fru fru pineapple topped dogs with peanut butter this is old style 4th of july chargrilled hotdogs and hamburgers makes my mouth water ok so visualize and taste this in your mind first the juicy hamburgers that have the hardwood charcoal taste that makes your mouth water the crispy ice berg lettuce juicy tomato and onion make this a purist burger lovers dream real good home made taste so now act you like you always do on the 4th of july and get an all beef hotdog first a warning you will crave their hotdogs after you eat em the crispy plump skin that cracks in your mouth and the taste is like when you were a kid and watching the fire works on the fourth add the spicy brown mustard with their ketchup hot sauce and buddy you got yourself dilemma the dilemma you ask is do you order one more hotdog cause they are soooo goood try the italian for a spicy dog dont start with me on the fries and onion rings just make sure you wear your fat pants motor out and going back for another dog
__label__0 we wanted to take you out for your last dinnerso we got to thinking what place has specials on a tuesdayand i remembered chompies has a specialand a food challenge and that is how i ended up at chompies on a tuesday they were featured on tv i think its man vs food but im not sure bc of this food challenge of theirs on tuesdays they have a special ayce jewish sliders fries with the purchase of a beverage for 1195 keep in mind a plate of 3 jewish sliders fries is 1195 i was told the specialties here are sliders the sliders themselves are a decent size id say maybe its the same size as the tiny mcds burgers but taller jewish sliders have potato cakes in them western sliders dont breakfast sliders are something completely different everything we ordered was ehhhh befitting of a meh ive experienced better rating two things that did impress me however were 1 they place pickles on the table right when you sit down im not a pickle girl myself but its a nice gesture 2 everyone here is so friendly i mean genuinely friendly idk i think most arizonians in general are friendlier than the californians i encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa and our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7that was pretty cool of her im glad i went here for the experience but i wouldnt come back again lesson learned dont trust a bunch of postgym hungry nonyelping boys to pick a dinner spot
__label__1 icey iced ice tasty and refreshing ritas delivers you cant help but smile as you walk in the door anticipating the tasty goodness that is lined up in front of you they have simple cream ice milkshakes gelati italian ices frozen custard frozen custard cookies and on and on we stopped by on a random warm afternoon after passing the new store and noticing the sign a few samples later we were sure that wed found a winner my only ouch came when i found out the calories and fat in my blendini mix glad i shared it well just make ritas an occasional splurge yum blendini we recommend the vanilla custard with toffee d see ya there
__label__1 im apparently not as big into greek as some of the others have posted but i can honestly say anyone whos given this place less than three stars probably just expected too much i had the best greek salad that ive ever had and i will agree with one review that it was definitely too light on the feta the service was great food was excellent and while it may have been a bit on the pricey side i felt as though it was a great value not one of the places i would take outoftowners and rave about but a great little spot to hit for lunch
__label__1 everytime my sister comes to town we go striaght from the airport to karshs our intent is to buy bagels and we do but we can never stop there and wind up with a variety of goodies all that we have comsumed over the years has been really great as for service always with a smile and friendly attitude we used to go here all the time when we lived on n central but since we moved to the other side of the world it has become a special occasion place so please open one near us too
__label__1 i moved to az about five months ago and have had two tragically bad haircuts from two other salons i wear my hair in a short pixie cut and its very hard to find someone with the skills to do it right so i dont end up with a mans cut i found epic salon here on yelp and decided to give it a try i could not be more pleased my appointment yesterday was with chey and shes wonderful i am very exacting when it comes to how i like my hair cut and am fluent in industry terms so i can articulate what i want chey listened very well and understood what i wanted she totally delivered i am so very relieved to have found her and at 26 cut only no blow out its a real deal
__label__1 when you walk in its dark and relaxing the atmosphere is nice quiet with alot of dark wood highliting the place the food is good but be careful because the price can add up quickly this will always be a restaurant i go to with burgers and steaks and spinach dip the best way to think of this place is a lower grade of houstons its almost there but not quite
__label__1 the corner bakery was aok to me it seemed like an elevated paradisepanera i had the cobb salad and it was perfectly chopped and dressed the desserts looked really good but a little on the pricey side for me to try that day ill be back because i really enjoyed the atmosphere and the great customer service
__label__1 haus murphys was my first german food experience ever the cuisine was ok but it isnt something id shove people down to get to i went with a friend who lived in germany for a bit and he said that murphys wasnt quite up to par we ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer the sausages were tasty but they were a bit cold for something that is labeled a sampler i felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it i dont know for sure what types they were but they didnt taste unique to me as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket the sausages were served with three types of condiments a sweet style mustard a dijon style mustard and ketchup blended with curry which im told is a recent favorite of the german kids brought over from turkish immigrants for our entrees we all had some type of schnitzel that same friend told me to try the wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of german cuisine so all our schnitzels came out and mine was the blandest my friends schnitzels had different gravies toppings and stuff and my poor little wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone you have to get that wiener schnitzel wet with gravy no biggie im a foodie so ill eat it a schnitzel is basically german country fried pork not super exciting i copied my friend who lived in germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle as i wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible i dont know if its just haus murphys but the spatzle was kind of bland even with the gravy i do however like the word spatzle if i ever visited germany i would only say spatzle to everyone i also liked the other thing that was served with the entree it was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb probably spinach the beer here was good authentic german beer i didnt get drunk but i still dont remember what kind i had youll have to experiment service was excellent i read some reviews that said murphys was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us the waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely german not that i speak any german but it sounded sexy she was very helpful in describing everything from the food to the beer i ordered a bap big ass pretzel to go philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this bap was good it was expensive but it came out warm soft chewy the only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt to steal and modify a quote from a seinfeld episode that big ass pretzel made me thirsty note they dont actually have it on the menu as a bap would i return to murphys ehhh yeah to try some of the other things but i definitely cant see it as a place that i would be a regular at
__label__1 truly a great place the flights are fantastic the food great service also great try this place seriously the fewer words to describe the greatness the better
__label__1 good jib fast an friendly
__label__1 this was the perfect place for the family after a day at the resort the food was good especially the barbeque chicken the kids menu was wonderful my only complaint was that the server really could not answer questions about the menu
__label__1 in response to a recent thread about boba drinks in cenpho i said that rainbow served at least 1 flavor chai which my husband found to be just ok when hubby asked me this morning if i wanted to taste the rainbow for breakfast i asked him to check on the boba situation it turns out that rainbow listened and they now will add boba to any of their drinks the woman behind the counter said you can call ahead so you dont have to wait hubbys vanilla and my strawberry frap that he brought home today were still just ok the donuts are still really good and they finally have some stable hours 4 am to 8 pm
__label__1 more like 35 stars but im rounding up because the overall property was so nice good food good service good view overlooking the golf course i had the chicken caprese sandwich which was quite tasty but the burger my mom has was way better if you go here order a burger they are big juicy and super duper good its also super duper messy its a fork and knife type of burger their bloody mary is pretty good a little too tomatoy needed more seasoning moms john daly peach drink was refreshing good for cooling off and relaxing after a round of golf tater tots were served with our sandwiches and they were good but nothing all that special they were crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside but for this type of establishment i would have expectetd truffle tots or something different their relishes that they offered on the side were ok i was not impressed they tasted like they were from a bottle im sure they make their own relish im just saying they didnt taste any different than the ones you get at the store
__label__1 two weeks after i dropped off my computer for service with the geek squad i got it back with a new screen and hand rest they said 3 weeks and i got it in two and the openbox computer i purchased to use while mine was in the shop was returned with no problems i was so happy we purchased a new toshiba dvd player for 40 who knew that dvd players could be so cheap ive been using it all day and it works beatifully
__label__1 this was my first trip to culvers and it came highly recommended at my friends suggestion i tried the butter burger deluxe fried cheese curd and thei forgot what it was called but the frozen custard basically the equivalent of a dq blizzard the burger patties were paper thin thus the reason i ordered the double the lettuce was crisp tomatoes fresh bun soft and buttery i thoroughly enjoyed my burger very flavorful i had never had fried cheese curd and had no idea what to expect the closest thing i can think to compare these to would be mozzarella sticks they are about the size of a grape and full of salty cheesy goodness the custard was delicious i had the vanilla with butterscotch and oreos i ordered butterscotch and brownie pieces but there was a mixup but i had no complaints i really loved everything i had the menu is big and i cant wait to go next time so i can try something new the thing i didnt like was the bible verses all over the walls seriously its not that i am antireligion or anything i am catholic went to brophy and go to church twice a year i dont need it thrown in my face while trying to eat with my friends take a tip from in and out put them on the under side of your cups work on your subtlety culvers

__label__1 in town for our 5 year wedding anniversary sushi is one of our favs so after doing some reading on yelp off we went to sakana i must agree with many other yelpersthe nigiri is fantastic huge tasty pieces of super fresh fish im craving it now as im writing this im so glad i read the reviews and ordered several items from the nigiri menuit was fantastic the rolls while well priced were a little disappointing maybe it was just our selections but nothing really jumped out at useverything was pretty bland we asked our server for recommendations and everything was a california roll plus this or that pretty blah even the mexican caliente roll was rather uneventful the service was awesome everyone was friendly efficient well organized the atmosphere was rather mainstream which was fine with me i did have to laugh as the first song we heard when we sat down was a pitbull song which another reviewer bemoaned the volume wasnt offensive so it really only served to make me laugh the customer appreciation menu and kirin beer special is genius so many customer appreciation menus are pretty sparse but theirs is well fleshed out and offers a lot of options we each ordered kirins while we waited for our table we were told it would be 1520 minutes but it was maybe 5 minutes and got 2 appetizers for 50 cents each pretty cool the scallop poppers were yummy the edemame was well edamame not a huge serving but what do you want for 50 all in all a good dinner we know when we go for sushi that its probably going to be a pricy night not at sakanait was probably the best meal we had in scottsdale at the very best price if were back in town we will definitely return ill just get more creative in my roll selectionor maybe just stick with the nigiri yum
__label__1 take the whole family and get a nice table outside the burgers are good the fried zucchini is better and the the barbecue chicken is amazing
__label__0 ok im very surprised by the reviews on here im not one to want to write negative reviews but our food was so bad i couldnt help myself maybe this place was having an off night tonight but their pizza barely had any cheese on it and the crust was soggy unfortunately the pizza was better than the wings that were overly breaded and soggy as well thank god we had a groupon and didnt have to pay full price wont be ordering from here again disappointing
__label__1 we come here once every two months for date night the serivce is generally slow because these are students but everyone is super nice and tries their best luckily every issue weve had has been with confidence for the front of house stuff speaking up looking at you in the eyes the food is always excellent generally they dont always offer everything on the menu but its generallty the cod or sole the filet is always fantastic desserts are yummy really everything is good the price cannot be beat 15 for a 5 course meal dont expect to get a last minute reservation its generally for a few weeks out we like this place and happily tell others about it every chance we get
__label__1 i like the bamboo club but it doesnt seem to bode well with purists it is a very americanized spin on chinese food with some dishes it works well and others not so much i struggle with a fierce addiction to panda express so i refer to it from time to time but i feel im justified this time bamboo club is like a deluxe version of panda express in fact their best dish is also the orange chicken only done much more tastefully than their greasy counterparts its a little overpriced considering what they are offering semiglorified mall food but all in all not bad
__label__0 worst store in the chain i agree with one poster that its not crowded but it also is out of items more than any other store it also is so understaffed its impossible to get help if you need it and if you ask someone that works here that you finally locate my experience is that they wont know what your asking for anyway i recently was in the store asking about a certain item by susan lenart kazmer the person looked right at me and said oh we dont carry that artist you might try hobby lobby they get a little credit for trying to help but susans line is a michaels only item i gave the woman the line name and said no we dont carry that im sure i pointed at the huge display in front of me of susan items and her answer oh that must be brand new i said nope it came out three years ago now can you see if you have this specific item she said oh we cant do that and she walked off talking to her friend the only other employee in the store that i had seen ok bad but any store can have a bad employee right so i go up to pay a pleasant young girl asks me if i have a michaels card i say sure do and hand it to her oh thats not a michaels card ours are red i explain that its a gold card for people who spend more money and that as a professional artist im there quite a bit she says ive never heard of that before well its a michaels card just read the front it says michaels right there she stands looking at me so i said try scanning it i promise it will work she scans it and then says oh it says you have a 5 off coupon loaded on this card my response good you get a five dollar coupon for every 100 you spend now she looks scared and says the dreaded words im not sure let me call the manager so 20 minutes go by and who shows up the lady that argued about the susan lenart items they finally agree to try it and im finally out the door just 40 minutes later and thats not even the bad part i went into this store to have something framed that was three weeks ago they tell me every day it will be the next day all to no avail they use every excuse imaginable custom frames take time or custom mat colors are hard to get each time i explain its a off the shelf frame there only cutting a black mat they say oh that should be fast will have it tomorrow i wouldnt shop here again if it was all free this store is a joke just keep driving and go to the large store at power and mckellips its a much larger store with competent staff and about twice the selection its well worth the drive and the cost of gas i live less than two miles from the gateway store and can still drive make my purchases and drive home much faster than trying to shop at the local gateway store they have even framed two other items while im still waiting for the gateway store to cut a simple mat
__label__1 good boutique hotel with nice amenities clean and contemporary id definitely stay here again
__label__1 this is a difficult review to write my family started eating here when they first opened we were a once a week customer very happy with the food and service pizza is delicious then one evening we placed our order asking for the special we always get a 2 pizza deal when we received our order they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table i immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised it turns out they have 2 specials a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal the employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal i spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which i agreed to nearly 10 minutes later the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza he was going to have to charge us for it i refused and now nearly 2 years later we have chosen not to return to this establishment my money is important to me and it should be as important to any business especially a small local business i now choose a place slightly further away but one that appreciates its customers pizza delicious customer appreciation needs improvement hope some changes have been made over the last couple of years
__label__1 would have been 4 stats based on prior visit this past visit the service was just garbage not the servers fault she should have never been on the floor in the first place pretty annoyed that she had to ask other servers for assistance while taking our order whats the soup i dont know jim whats the soup is there cheese on the french dip i dont know karen is there cheese on the french dip the food has always been great and we will be back hopefully i can give them 4 stars next visit oh yeah love thenew location
__label__1 im from the east coast so living in arizona feels like living in the land that chinese food forgot george and sons offers the closest thing to chinese food that i have found in arizona yes i know this isnt real chinese cuisine just look at my picture pf changs is not chinese food and that is the best i have eaten before i came here all the other chinese food that i have found is full of msg and makes me sick the restaurant is cozy and relaxing and the staff is very attentive the sesame chicken is very good i recommend asking for firecracker chicken it is not on the menu just ask for the firecracker pork but with chicken it has the right kick to it i would not recommend the orange peal chicken after eating 12 of my plate i want to swear off anything orange for a month i guess i needed something less sweet with a more varying taste last time i went in i had the three amigos which was very good this is shrimp chicken and beef in a brown sauce poured over a hot skillet plate at your table i would recommend any of the three i mentioned
__label__1 huge fan love poncho the birthday strobe lights the food and the service this is a goto for my boyfriend and i when were looking for sushi more likely than not well opt for the all you can eat option for 20 person with that comes with miso soup salad sashimi your ayce picks ice cream and with a special frequent customer request this awesome pan seared naturally fatty sea bass belly and salmon cheeks which are amazing not a taste for everyone kinda bizarre for most but this will be well appreciated by traditional asian taste and perfect for me loyalist here
__label__1 another great fox concept so glad he opened something in downtown phoenix i hosted a large group dinner in the back room and we had an amazing experience the service was phenomenal they even took multiple photos of our group on 2 different occasions the set menu was fantastic i really felt like we got a taste of what the restaurant had to offer i highly recommend the beet and apple salad the crab stuffed chicken and the salted caramel pudding or blueberry cheesecake absolutely delicious i went back a few days later for lunch and wasnt disappointed i enjoyed the sweet potato tortelli it was melt in your mouth good
__label__1 a very tasty place for breakfast i strenuously object to any place that doesnt serve hash browns but really thats my only complaint they have a ton of different omeletsscrambles you choose and you can make your own example spinach tomato sausage bacon with american cheese as a scramble with salsa the coffee is good i hear from my wife and the cinnamon roll is a real treat not the best cinnamon roll ever in a million years but a good 8510 it is true that there can be a very long wait so plan ahead for sure youll be waiting outside they grill their wheat toastsolid
__label__1 we just moved to town and were looking for a place exactly like this this bar is not posh it is not shiny or pretty it doesnt have a huge menu and that is all fine by me what it does have is a friendly wait staff plenty of seating goodok live music and a great bar selection the mix of people that was there the night we stopped in was entertaining i cant really comment on that as i still think everyone here in phoenix is crazy lol either way it seems to have that good old suburban bar feel to it which is nice and cozy when you dont feel like dolling yourself up and having a fancy night out
__label__1 service was great and always an interesting time on a late saturday night
__label__1 house of tricks is a great place for dinner if youre looking to go out for a special occasion its not somewhere id go on any given night seeing as how the bill is about 100 for a dinner for two i appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it as i dont eat any red meat we had the scallops as an app while the serving was small as expected the scallops were the prettiest ones i have ever seen for dinner i had the ahi tuna it was way bigger than i expected i couldnt even finish it but my date didnt hesitate to finish it for me we sat outside as the sun was setting the atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing we were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street if youre sitting at the tables next to the wall id say it comes up to your elbows anyway there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again otherwise he was pretty cool sort of a no sense of urgency kind of server but we werent in too much of a hurry anyway
__label__0 lost 2 stars sat in the restaurant for 15 minutes no waitress no water no nothing we left sad part was there was people who left then came back and got service before us the guy who came in after us got seated hot tea and his order taken while we just sat and waited seriously doubt we will be going back now if you have an hour or so to kill you can wait for your foodservice in there
__label__1 first off its fast chinese and they lived up to their promise on that one we did get our dinners fast i am a huge fried rice fan and i have to say theirs was horrible stick to plain white or brown rice however i had the beef with broccoli and that was ok its not like beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways so i can confidently say they didnt mess it up what i do like about this place besides how quick our food came out is that you can do the meal deal typically only offered at lunch for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner i love crab puffs again theirs was just ok and i didnt care for the egg roll all that much overall it was fast filled me up with a huge portion that i took home lots of left overs they were open kind of late until 10 and it wasnt the worse thing i ever ate also they had very friendly service
__label__1 im glad i bought my tickets back in august when the event was first posted im not sure the organizers knew what an amazing turn out they would have but the event was sold out so tickets were not available at the door we arrived at 1115 doors opened at 11 and while standing in line to get in there was a staff person checking to make sure we all had tickets and letting people know that if they did not the event was sold out once inside it was a sea of cupcakes tiny cupcakes that were delicious i didnt taste one that i didnt like liberty market was my fave i think espresso carmel and red velvet yum cruelty free cakes makes delicious vegan cupcakes too i also liked the ones from cry baby ranch im going to have to find them again at the 20th street farmers market and old town scottsdale farmers market and everyone was so nice 10 got you all the cupcakes you could eat and water and milk and it was for two very worthy causes singleton moms and safe haven for animals there were also raffles a cupcake eating contest and cupcake decorating for the kids so many festivals these days charge you to get in and then once inside charge for everything else people cant afford that these days so it was refreshing to go to an event and not be nickel and dimed for everything i appreciate that and best of all my daughter had a great time there were lots of people so it was a little overwhelming for her but she loved it both of us are just coming down from our sugar high it was great to see gabi and lindsey manning the yelp booth and our very own thomas s helping with emcee duties will i be back next year you bet and you should come toojust make sure you get your tickets early
__label__1 this ice has the abilty to make you feel cold on a 100 degree day i am hooked on the key lime alexs lemonade and florida orange very nice staff friendly and free samples
__label__1 first off i am not a science person unless social sciences counts in which case i have a bachelors degree my boyfriend on the other hand was raised by two phd holding physicists and studied electrical engineering in college he has weird accelerometertype machines in his garage and has conversations that would make the cast of the big bang theory proud kudos to the arizona science center for offering exhibits that appealed to the both of us we started on the 4th floor at the solarville exhibit which focused on energy the environment and conservation it talked about individual household energy usage and ways to reduce environmental impact the 3rd floor had the forces of nature and technology exhibits which both offered interactive and informative displays the 2nd floor was all about electricity so naturally my electrical engineer bf showed off his knowledge the coolest part of the museum for me was the first floor at the all about me exhibit it covers the systems of the human body and even has a stomach you can walk through and a giant nose that blows out objects the neuroscience portion was very interesting and i enjoyed taking the interactive memory tests admission was 14 not including special exhibits or films we had a limited amount of time and didnt get to check out any of the extras imax film planetarium pirate exhibit we saw almost all of the museum in 2 and half hours we were there in the early afternoon on a weekday and it seemed like most of the school groups had cleared out by then will definitely be back perhaps for the adults night out nothing against kids but i can only handle so many middle schoolers at time before i want to scream
__label__1 i wish i lived in scottsdale i stopped by yogurtland because i went to spring training and i wish i could have stayed forever the quality of the frozen yogurt is impeccable so many flavors i mixed raspberry cheesecake with vanilla bean also tried the pbj flavor um yes tangerine tango and my usual goto tart very extensive toppings bar good price as well i just love froyo next time im in scottsdale this will be one of the first places i go to
__label__1 food is whatevers drinks the same however this dnb compared to the one in tempe is much better if youre really just interested in getting some game time in the on at tempe marketplace is crazy busy like 11 people waiting in line to play basketball crazy when i go to an arcade and am already dropping 20 bucks to play games i want that gaming experience to be nonstop however the drive is really far for someone that lives in gilbert so thats really the only reason why it gets a 4 star
__label__1 had to update because weve now tried the pizza for all the times we have visited weve never tried a pizza too many other really good options to choose i guess we ordered the italian classic veggies meat we ordered it a little well donecrispy and were not disappointed it was hot fresh and cooked perfectly service was great as usual even though they were completely slammed with customers the day before thanksgiving filing numerous growlers of their pumpkin beer which sold out in less than record time we were there again last weekend for the football games and made it in time to order our favorite breakfast items eggs benedict and the braised pork dish with beans potatoes two eggs and fresh warm tortillas it was fantastic this dish just like many others possibly all others is plenty for 2 to share service was exceptional and the crowd fun and rowdy rooting for their teams and az won so there were a lot of happy customers that day
__label__0 cool place but dont try to arrange a special event the proprietor was arragont unflexible and unethical when i held my friends bachelorette party at the duce be warned
__label__1 while my visit to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur the amazing food i ate from diamonds after a few hours of harder than intended drinking were just what the doctor ordered my buddy did all the ordering so all of it was a surprise when i sat down to eat quite possibly the best hotandsour soup ive had in my life and all of the everything else that was ordered was smack yo mama good the fried rice and lomein were divine especially cuz it was a big diet cheat for me and the egg foo yung egg foo yum ive had much more bad egg foo yung than i have had good egg foo yung to the point that i never think to order it cuz it usually sucks but so not the case at diamonds the lady at the register super cute and i kinda like the stab joint classic chinese restaurant looks of this place no windows yes d five stars the food seriously speaks for itself
__label__1 i am beginning to be hooked on sushi two years ago i would have told you that sushi was just wrongbut now i am wrong i went to sushi eye on friday with my wonderful and lovely friend you know who you are i was excited to go there especially with the rave reviews at first i was a little put off since i thought that our server was a little bit of a moron with a splash of attitude i ordered an iced tea and before it took her over ten minutes to come back so i could get some pink packets to sweeten it up and that tea was dark after that little slip everything was perfectthough my miso soup didnt have any seaweed in itwhich is odd in my book i had the spicy scallop and the philly rollboth were awesome and my friends california roll with asparagus was the best i will have to order that next time for sure the sushi chef was very nice and the other server there was more attentive i loved the menu and it had a lot to offer and since i am dont know a lot of my sushi yet i liked it that they had descriptions the place was clean and i really liked the layout i will have to go there again and have some sake as well
__label__0 this place is more miss than hit i stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled the food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly ive never had the experiences that phoenician c has but i will admit that this can be one of the lower end mcds that ive been to in this town curse you mcgriddle
__label__1 angel sweet gelato is a welcome treat on a hot day it sits in a small strip in the middle of mesa riverview but if you can find it west of logans its worth a stop the selection of flavors is large including a dozen dairyfree fruit flavors that arent quite as decadent as the dairy gelatos in the lefthand case ive tried the lemon and all the berry flavors and havent found anything that wasnt delicious the prices are reasonable and you can order sizes from one small scoop to a big box all unfortunately served in styrofoam there isnt a lot of seating in angel sweet but ive never seen it full get a punch card if you live in the area if you like firemen this would be a good place to see them hanging out
__label__1 based off of these great reviews i decided to give zs greek restaurant a try from my experience i give this restaurant an overall four stars derived by their greek styled atmosphere great food selection and customer satisfaction zs is a family friendly zone which is good for all ages from kids to adults there is barely any waiting line plus the food is dished out quick best of all there is a drive through window which allows easier pickup especially on the go i would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never experienced greek food and is willing to taste a different styled recipe from their original comfort zone everything is prepared tenderly juicy and well seasoned give zs greek a try
__label__1 went to the rooste for a christmas eve dinner among a small group 9 friends i had never been had heard the name many times over the years when i had previously lived in tempe been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky thats all a lie it sets up high and has a wonderful view its not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true you wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant you can self park but why bother go for the valet you pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as i was inside the door the smell escapes you immediately thank goodness you see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have i arrived at a few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring first stop the bar its a limited full bar and for this it losses a star from the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing it was a band but i wouldnt book em but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse you see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know youre welcome in your jeans moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps hey i went for the slide it was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman we skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert next time ill reverse that decision the menu was very good several steak cuts enchiladas fried chicken bbq beef pork ribs seafood a burger pork chops most plates 15 20 while waiting for the salad course a magician name flash comes up and asks if wed like some magic that night he works for tips he went about his tricks and blew our minds this guy i would higher for an event never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again so if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic the food arrives the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection my medium rare tbone was actually medium rare for once my steak was tender and taste fabulous the food didnt hold its heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard bakedmashed or fried idahos extra charge for a standard potato why minus another 12 star but over all it was a good meal we barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us and we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home it was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried 4 of us dug into this slice all in all it its a great steakhouse prices lower than lonestar and steak portions ounces bigger for your money plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far oh yeah im a fan and will be returning again and again when i want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal i highly recommend rustlers rooste
__label__1 beautiful casino im into architect yet if you are a slot machine gambler for the fun of it or not this may not be a place i would dump my hard earnings into even if it where just for fun i was out her with my uncle and although i didnt play he was having a good time playing 25 hours straight yet as i followed in from one slot to another after spending a lot of his money down the drain i noticed that not only did he not get any winnings but no one around was winning either during the entire time he played really not only was he in the hole but many others very odd that i noticed this also no one was working the floor asking anyone if theyd like a drink perhaps i may be used to how vegas does it im curious for other feedback from other attendees at this place have you had any winnings we initially came out her for the vietnamese concert and show i would provide a rating for that yet its not a regular performance at this casino so i will refrain
__label__1 this by far has to be the best filibertos location i have been to the phoenix tempe chandler prescott mesa gilbert tucson and casa grande locations clean salsa bar with chunky and smooth salsa options free chips most places will charge you for a small order gold peak green tea smoothies and juices video games tvs and free wifi fruit filled churros the tortillas are fresh and the place was actually clean shocking for what it is this is a good location to stop by at if you are in the mood for this type of mexican food
__label__1 the server could have been better she spilled a coke on my lap this made me late for my movie the wait was soso however the food was cooked to my liking i will go back
__label__1 i love this restaurant very cheap very clean the food is sooo good my mom and i eat there once every couple of weeks sometimes twice once a week the staff is very friendly and attentive the environment is very comforting i recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty mexican food
__label__1 pleasant courteous low prices and your clothes are ready the next day what more could you ask for
__label__1 these guys have the tacos and nachos thing figured out great decor and hot hot waitresses we had lunch and it was pretty quiet good service im sure things get crazy at night though
__label__1 this is simply a poor substitute for the los dos molinos in south phoenix it is a pale shade of itself the salsa is spicy but it doesnt have any of the same excitement i think its partly the downtown location in a strip mall not that 98 of restaurants in phoenix arent in strip malls but the mexcian pizza and chicken enchiladas just didnt have the same loving kick and spice when you are craving mexican downtown thisll do in a pinch but make room and time to head out to the original deal the one with 5 alarm salsa and huge patios margaritas the size of ones head and bring a group of friends to indulge
__label__1 the veg burger is fantastic make sure you ask to try all the different aioli sauces especially with the tots
__label__0 can i just say i hate everything about this store if youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price then i guess this is the place for you if you are trying to sell anything good luck their askew sense of fashion will make most of your goods obsolete unless its tacky 80s regurgitation the chick actually told me that the band tshirts i was trying to pawn were too outdated while i had a bay city rollers and rockos modern life shirt in my hand off their rack they are incredibly overpriced the staff has an elitist air for some reason which you think would be hard to pull off in a tutu leggings and cowboy boots saving grace they have some killer old punk and skateboarding tshirts on the cheap for guys and gals but the only time i even go here is when the boyfriend decides to go thru eastside records vinyl catalog in its entirity its like a platos closet for lady gaga
__label__1 this review is for the food only if you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that arent food related youll have to check out another review i love lgo the food is absolutely top notch and i love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things youve never heard of like their venice beach burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs tofu chorizo spinach and other goodies it comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic i eat breakfast here all the time and i have never been disappointed also if youre in a hurry grab one of their premade granolayogurtfruit parfaits yum
__label__1 we ate there last night and were very pleased our meals and service the ribs were especially good we would go back again
__label__0 this place is pure crap the players are subpar and unentertaining especially mike clement and julie martinez and the door men are ridiculously cheesy and rude im a regular at piano bars all over the country when im traveling petes piano bar in austin howl at the moon in scottsdale and the big bang in tempe is a terrible destination save your tips and bar for the aforementioned places and take my word for it
__label__1 bring a flashlight it is so dark inside you can not read the menu but the waiter was so well versed we just used his recommendations we all had filets cooked to perfection and served on a 400 degree hot plate they recommend the lobster mashed potatoes but did not feel they were worth the price tag the wine list is extensive and expensive if you are looking for fancy this is the place but we went after a round of golf and they were very accommodating great special occasion dinner but not your everyday steak joint
__label__1 i was seated at the bar a very nice young man was working the bar an provided good conversation i was offered a delicious chicken bacon bleu cheese amuse yum i ordered a pine nut pesto pizza which wad delivered by the chef the crust was perfect thick enough for structure and substance but thin enough to hide behind the flavors of tomato and pine nut pesto the cheese was also just right delicious i also had the chicken panini which was fantastic the bread was a bit hard but i think i was too busy talking and let it sit too long all in all id definitely recommend lacademie if youre in that area of scottsdale
__label__0 from my door its a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to dukes they have a nice patio they have enough tvs to show all mlbnflnba games they have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables yet ive only been to dukes a few times and i am not going back this place is just bad mixed drinks are poured short and use cheap mixers such as bottled sour mix for margaritas they offer a pretty basic beer selection i think pbr pitchers might be more modestly priced but that might be only when theyre on special the food is pretty bad even for bar food and pricey sure the menu is gigantic and ive tried many different items but i didnt find anything good everything seems to be made from freezer to fryer or packaged products im not exaggerating the burger and fries for about 8 is a thin previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries i could go on about salads sandwiches and ribs in the same price range you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at four peaks or zipps or even devils advocate one of the owners was there on a few occasions i guess being the boss of and drinking in his own bar is some sort of dream of his he treats the place like his kingdom hell ask patrons how is everything and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say i feel bad for the rest of the service staff they seem to be above average but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesnt matter in this city sports bars are a dime a dozen id rather go elsewhere
__label__1 thats amore is awesome im glad to see that a nice clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized it deserves the five star ratings the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor its a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot

__label__1 i saw this place on a food network series in november when my family went to phoenix in march for spring training i knew we had to stop here it was the first stop after getting off the plane and getting the rental car it was in a sketchy area in the town and far enough from the freeway when we were there the workers gave us samples of the different foods i got the chicken fried rice combo with jade red chicken and the pollo diablo the pollo diablo had a nice spicy flavor and the jade red chicken was also very good the snickerdoodle was very soft and chewy which was a good thing for me this will be a permanent stop in phoenix for spring training trips
__label__1 this place seems to get better every time i visit the first time was a friday night out with the guys we met up for dinner and i had and loved the pulled pork and sweet potato fries after dinne we got our drink on with a live band the waitress was helpful in getting us drunk off a variety of liquors and the shots kept on coming it was a blast the second time was more laid back just grabbing a beer with a girlfriend it was a tuesday and the place was pretty busy the next time me and the girlfriend showed up completely wasted and they had an irish band playing it was a perfect way to end our night after clubbing at the gay bar we had a baileys nightcap and everything went dark from there awesome night
__label__1 as i mentioned in my previous review maizies was my favorite spot with the first urban wine walk so it makes perfect sense that if the uww returns so do i well return to maizies that is we started there this time and enjoyed all three wines they were tasting their pizza and bruschetta bites were great and after we quickly inhaled the samples we decided to get more food the menu is pretty huge and everything sounded and looked delicious yes we were eyeing everybody elses plate as well the bar seats are good for that after oohing and ahing over what we saw we decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip that came with chips and pit bread it was great the best part about maizies is that they just seem to do things right friendly casual service so you feel like youre among friends all sorts of specials listed up on the boards so 1 you dont have to feel dumb asking and 2 you dont have to feel even dumber when you forget and have to ask again beer of the month always fun to try 20 off beer or wine togo what is this vegas happy hour specials you had me at daily the list goes on and on good food great energy small cozy inside and an nice patio space too i have only been twice now but have have fabulous experiences each time a few more times and they win the fifth star easy
__label__0 if you like terrible service and overpriced food youve come to the right place if i knew before i went in there i would be paying 1600 for macaroni and cheese and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it while my glass remained empty i wouldve stayed away which is what you should do food wasnt awful although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a rock bread on their sandwiches the mac n cheese was nothing special the service was beyond poor first and last time i will eat at hard rock cafe
__label__0 my wife and i were looking for a dinette table we looked at many places and ended up at the roomstore we found a great table and decided to purchase the item the salesman was nice and didnt provide too much pressure there is a large selection of itemscouches tables chairs dressers etc my problem was that we bought the table and had a deferred pickup due to moving into a new home several weeks down the road i placed a small down payment to reserve my item after several weeks i contacted the roomstore to pick up my item since i just moved into my new home my item was not in stock and was told to call back later in the week i called 4 days later and was informed the item was now available today i went to pay the balance of my purchase and take home the table small problem the table and chairs are not at this location i was given the choice to pick up the item at the distribution center 30 minutes away or wait until until tuesday i wish that during my several contacts during this process that someone would have told me that i wouldnt be able to pick up my item here or wait several other days i was not happy now i have to go back once again to pick up the table and chairs
__label__1 we stumbled upon this little place in a worn strip mall by accident but it ended up being a very happy accident yes it is true that the decor will not be gracing the pages of fashion magazines anytime soon but this is a clean nofrills kind of place there is also no point in coming here if you are pressed for time because it is not fast food by any stretch of the imagination most importantly the food is good really good the menus must have changed since other reviewers visited because there was no arabic on the menu everything is in english i had the falafel plate and my companion had the lamb shank and rice both meals came with a wonderful lentil soup that i have had at fattoush many times but this one was so much better the falafel plate came with falafel of course a questionable salad pita that looked homemade and some of the tastiest hummus ive ever had it was a huge amount of food but it was so good that i was compelled to order an extra side of hummus to go with the leftovers the lamb was apparently very tasty also im not much of a lamb fan so i didnt try it the accompanying rice was very tasty though very complex with many different flavors but none of them were overwhelming at 799 for the falafel and 999 for the lamb plate the prices are more than reasonable especially when you consider that each entree can easily end up being two meals i admit that i am partial to middleeastern food and rarely meet a falafel that i dislike but this was definitely one of the better examples of the cuisine in the metro phoenix area i will definitely be back and maybe next time ill try the chicken
__label__1 this little taco shop gets 5 stars the fish tacos were out of this world breaded and fried to perfection i also tried the al pastor taco that was marinated well and you can taste the marinade in every bite i also tried molotes for the first time the cilantro salsa and red salsa was homemade and oh so good and spicy the quesadillas are like cheese crisps i am so disappointed that i did not find this place earlier since its so close to home i have to try the other items in their menu soon price is very reasonable as their tacos range from 1150
__label__1 its true there is a real bull and a slide this place has been around forever i think my parents used to go there back in the 70s i cant say much about the food since ive only been here for happy hour which was pretty decent their hh included top shelf for 3 bucks and some cheap beers they also have appetizers on the hh menu sliders quesadillas and potato skins that sort of stuff pretty nice view and going during happy hour you can see all the people sitting in traffic on the 10 and cheers them from the balcony
__label__1 if you are a beer snob stay at home trying to make it yourself if you enjoy a decent local beer in an old chandler building with a nice atmosphere give this place a shot the owner used to be a brewmaster at four peaks brewery which is a local favorite in tempe i am not a fan of the overthetop hops that a lot of folks enjoy a few of the offerings here have a bit too much bite for me the red ale was my favorite until they changed the recipe and over did the bitterness right now i get a sun devil ale when i go in and it is pretty good they will bring you a taster if you ask and will explain the offerings to help you choose the food is always good it is a bar so dont expect 5 star cuisine the fries are great and the sandwiches and salads are good as well i havent been disappointed with a meal yet even when busy service is decent enjoy the beer watch the game and let it all unfold
__label__1 i am a shoe addict i also appreciate a good bargain whenever i am bored and have a little time on my hands i like to take a walk through dsw i think it is kind of like playing dress up you can try on anything and everything such fun this location is one of the better ones i have visited it is wellorganized and the stock turns over regularly it is one of those hit or miss places i will either leave with nothing or with an obnoxious amount of new footwear you just never know it has a fairly large clearance section as well if you have the patience to look bargains can often be found definitely sign up for their rewards program you will receive coupons regularly yay happy hunting
__label__1 i dream about their chopped saladi too would use it as my screen saver if i didnt share a computer
__label__1 this goodwill is alright i have been to better their selection is okay cleanliness is okay and organization is okay all goodwills prices are the same as far as i know the staff is helpful and i never have trouble finding somebody if i need help
__label__0 i was very impressed by their website and their services and setting up my files for my cards was super easy and straightforward i ordered samples before my cardsthree weeks ago havent received anything yet now i know that the turnaround time on cards is between 1214 days but i didnt receive any confirmation that theyd been shipped or what method they were being shipped through luckily i was able to call them and talk to people who straightened everything out but i really get a strong feeling that theyre a very small company thats still trying to learn the ropes the biggest problem i had was that my shipping and billing addresses are different theres a box where you type in your shipping address then it takes you to the billing section when i got my order confirmation i noticed that my billing address and shipping address were listed as the same at the top of the order then lower down in the order section was where i had typed in my correct shipping address yet it was partially cut off i called them about it and they assured me that it was shipping to the correct address however once i called ups and had them reassure me that my cards were coming to the correct address i received another email from taste saying that the reason my samples werent delivered was because i didnt give them the correct address i looked back at my confirmation receipt and the correct address was typed into the bottom of my order it was a matter of not paying attention i guess suggestions would be to either pay closer attention to their customers entire order or to work on the billingshipping page instead of leaving it as a box to type words in especially if its not going to be read pros are that they get back to you very quickly and make sure that your custom order is correct for print cons seem to be the shipping and customer care portion will i order from them again possibly but my trust has definitely been tested
__label__1 cholla trail is a lot of fun and moderate hike echo canyone is a lot of fun but also more challenging overall both trails are so much fun and a great workout
__label__0 i went there for happy hour the chips and salsa were good i was a little disappointed in the service we had to ask for everything i sat there with an empty glass for quite some time the bartender could have been having an off night so i will give them a try again
__label__1 was not satisfied first trip service was awful and place was deafening but we thought food was worth trying again so now that the place has been open and matured it is much better our sever was good the place was about 12 empty which made the noise level much more bearable food very good not chicago family run good but for the valley very good i asked for my shrimp to be spicy and it was hsb cant handle so hot and his curried duck was mild as requested the mustard wraps unusual and tasty hsb loved the peanut sauce chicken and lemongrass salad good flavors we will be back
__label__0 i really dont get why everyone is raving this place ive been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito the portions are really small for the price that they charge there is too much tortilla for the meat i think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley
__label__1 went in to pick up lunch i ordered the bean cheese burrito per yelpers recommendation it took a long time for my order to be ready next time i will definitely call ahead the price was awesome and the food was really good i anxious to try more items on the menu
__label__1 love love love how can you not fall in love with this store the moment you walk in is beyond me its like entering that magical fairy tale land your mind goes to every time i start to sing or sit down at my piano and thats exactly what a music store should be it should bring you to that creative center where the outside world doesnt exist first and foremost the staff is extremely friendly both on the phone and in person ive spent i dont know how much of their time having them assist me in finding sheet music and theyve always been a gem and even gone so far as to go google searches for me while i was there and give me some additional leads its just an awesome amazing experience they also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end i always tell myself someday i am going to learn a new instrument and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 i want to play especially when i stare at the drums go to milano and experience what a music store is supposed to be
__label__1 i do love rum and should review the rum bar separately but both the rum bar and the breadfruit restaurant are equally awesome great recommendations from the waiter brown stew chicken and jerk chicken are really good really spicy on the jerk chicken but thats somewhat expected and perfect for me ill take my plantains baked over fried any day so good really great place to go for not so typical food the entire place is quite small in a perfect intimate way their seems to be a lot of pride in the menu environment and service which is rare to see in restaurant employees not to mention a perfect location very walkable to other nearby bars and easy to make a whole night of downtown phoenix
__label__1 id say 3 stars but since the have menudo everyday and prepare it at order ill go 4 street tacos are good so is the carne asada typical gringo mexican food
__label__1 im giving yolis 5 stars for the winning combination of great food for a great price at a quaint location went there on a saturday late in the morning and we were seated right away great little hideaway in downtown chandler i ordered the morning monte it was delicious my family ordered various other items and we all sampled a bit off each others plates and everything was excellent my favorite item was the chorizo burro excellent chorizo with the correct combination of meats and spices the waitress was friendly and we chatted with the owner and she was very nice also another really great thing about this place is the prices i dont think there are any items above 8 and most meals here are in the 67 range very reasonable for the good quality food you get after breakfast we took a walk around the courtyard and had a nice time looking around at the plants and exotic birds they have on site we also got a chance to meet the owner of the property and she was super nice also i will definitely be back to try out some other menu items
__label__1 amazing quesadillas i had the steak mushroom and cheese as recommended by our server and man was i impressed they are not the standard kind that i am used to fried and covered in lettuce and green sauce the al pastor burrito was so hot and tasty as well this is now my new favorite cheap delicious mexican joint i wish the salsas were better and didnt all light my mouth on fire but hey the food is awesome anyway and didnt need the salsas
__label__1 stopped by for a quick bite on a saturday afternoon did not realize that the place had just opened or at it appeared that way quite crowded with patrons a bubble machine and a dj it was bit loud with all the commotion but still within reason the menu is compact but offered all the usual suspects i went for the pulled pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw i dumped the cole slaw on top of the pork and went to town on the sandwich meat was moist and smoky the sauce had a hint of of kick very tasty the service was a bit slow but the place was pretty much full up so i expected it to take a bit of time good joint would return
__label__1 ok so iv been a starbucks junkie for yearsuntil i discovered dutch bros this location is my favorite although they are all good my favorite thing about dutch is you can order any blended drink sugar and fat free you cant do that with any frappes at starbucks you cant beat their customer service either all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat always greeted with a smile i once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new onethey exchanged my drink apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge added bonus is the stamp cards so if your an avid coffee drinker like me youll be saving some money to quick drivethrough for on the go
__label__1 it had been a few years since i last gave this place a try it hadnt blown me away as i had remembered but i was still up to giving it another shot i must say that this place is much better than i had remembered i stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time i ordered the luncheon special 3 cashew chicken served with an egg roll fried wonton fried rice and a fortune cookie for myself and a 1 special qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above for a friend to go each dish was only 625 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes i guess the qwik part wasnt just a clever name they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there i brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch yes i also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well it was a dark meat chicken white meat can be substituted in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews however it was done well no one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasnt a ton of sauce the egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well i like the fact that they will deliver as far south as camelback north to cactus east to 60th street and west to 96th they are open until 930 pm seven days a week which is nice as well i went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and i have to say that while the soup was good the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that i have had in arizona they dont have that just unfrozen taste that many restaurants have i think i would have given them that fifth star had they had both scallion pancakes and noodles w sesame sauce on their menu but alas they do not i look forward to going back and trying many of their other dishes
__label__1 just went for my first time last night with the girls two of us heard about it and after i read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out anyway we had a memorable evening with wine the makeyourown cheeseboard and the todiefor pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza it was topped with fried sage leaves different and delicious afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate sublime cant wait to go back and try other dishes definitely made it to my restaurants to frequent list
__label__1 this is a mom pop mexican restaurant on tempes east end the food is awesome and of the good homemade quality known the family for almost 30 yrs now
__label__0 first i hope la fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant second we miss the bloody mary bar too hubby i visited lf a few weeks ago on a saturday night for dinner we asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong okay she doesnt know beer we liked the chips salsa it was a good start then i took a sip of my water what the i know what tempe tap water tastes like but this was weird the aftertaste made me cringe i couldnt drink it even with a slice of lemon in it maybe it was the ice hubby ordered chicken enchiladas which he orders practically everywhere and it was so bad he didnt finish it my meal was not memorable either i wanted to love this place or at least like it we walked out of there terribly disappointed i doubt well go back
__label__0 its cute its homey however you close at 6pm on a wednesday night you were going to charge me 50 cents to process my debit card i left with one drink and wont be back too bad too since my best friend lives around the corner we would have lived here
__label__1 always fresh and perfectly prepared this is the only place my husband will take japanese visitors from out of town enough said
__label__1 i stayed here in march10 and thought the place was alright nothing to rave about but here was my experience pros 1 location was good for what i was there for work 2 the nightly rates were really cheap this had to do with my company more than the establishment though 3 easy enough drive tofrom the airport 4 you can almost bypass phoenix altogether getting to scottsdale 5 their was plenty of shopping places about a mile and a half up the road think best buy target mcdonalds etc 6 a pretty happening restaurantbar up the street that gets two thumbsup 7 the rooms were actually really spacious and niceit was like having a luxury one bedroom apartment scaled down for size full kitchen massive bathroom den seating area king size bed in a comfortably sized room 8 hot tub was rockin nobody gave us a hard time about having glass bottles out there cons 1 once i checked in i had to lug a ton of stuff over to a room in the one of the back buildings and i couldnt see my rental car maybe im weirdbut i like to have my car close by 2 i unpacked and got situated to find that the internet in my room wasnt working must have called the front office and they had to move me to an entirely different room mind you i just unpackedagh 3 i ate dinner a couple times with coworkers in their lounge while it was goodit wasnt great so we all ate at the restaurantbar up the street the rest of the time 4 be aware you stand a decent chance of see spiders looming aroundso you have been warned but otherwise its real clean id stay here again pending that i got the same room rates that i did last time but its my understanding having talked to the girls at the front desk that we got booked at unusually low rates dont get sucked into any of that timeshare crapthey dont push it like some other places ive beenbut its never a good investment
__label__1 great early bird specials on wine and minipitchers of beer before 5pm only 5 the food is very good and taylored to a wine menu a very nice place for a date with your wife or significant other
__label__1 bobby q is great we enjoyed everything brisket sandwich baby back ribs brisket with spicy sauce yum blooming onion just right baked potato crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside withe barbeque pork and the fixingsmmmmmmmm our waitress perfect go now
__label__1 surprised to have a good sushi place like this in fountain hills can get expensive but eat in or take out is always great fun to mingle with the chef while making the sushi
__label__1 got a great deal from home runcom and used it to find some good cigars staff is friendly and very knowledgeable
__label__1 if you can look past the giant meth billboard right outside and the general uncleanliness of the entire establishment its pretty wonderful especially if your intentions involve eating a whole lobster like myself gourmet house of hong kong has the cheapest whole lobster dishes ive ever found anywhere i dont mean a measly midwestern tourist trap restaurant kind of lobster i mean a damn good meaty savory juicy morsel of deliciousness its served a number of ways but i usually go for the black bean sauce style then i eat like nobodys watching vow to never let my boyfriend see me like this and usually end up getting sauce on my face clothing table neighbors etc go messy or go home
__label__1 sure the food is good but out of my last 20 take out orders they got it right maybe once the people making the food look so high you would think you were at cheba hut but i just love that damn broccoli and wisconsin cheese soup their fresh dark rye bread is always great i enjoy the italian quite a bit and the wife loves their tuna salad great healthy place for food if they arent too high to get your order right
__label__1 a little pricey for my liking but good nonetheless i really like the feel of the restaurant part cuban part puerto rican part spanish all classy a guitar player jammed away in a completely nonannoying way while we ate our meal and to me that is an accomplishment our calypso chips were outstanding to die for one of the best appetizers i can think of at the moment for my entree i ordered the ropa vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans a little heavy with the peppers however does anybody else think plantains smell like feet my date pointed this out and although i was surprised im inclined to agree that wont stop me from putting some into my stomach as soon as humanly possible
__label__1 just got 5 diamond dermabrasion on arms back and face and i love it she is a perfectionist organize clean and the most amazing quality service she finished my facial with ice i basically melted this is my best present for my coming b day this sunday i will look like i am in high school this weekend with m super fresh skin paulgstudiocom highly recommends this better that the red door service and amazing and real customer service she has a 12 off coupon on the entrance of the building for the first service please enjoy
__label__1 inexpensive tasty fast the gentle peanut dressing on the premeal salad gets you started on a simple nofrills meal with exactly one option from all of the classic dishes you expect at a thai restaurant in america massaman red green yellow or panang curry pad thai or chowmein meat or vegetable rice plates theres nothing extravagant in spices or food choices but you can order the spiciness level to you liking
__label__1 if you havent shopped at a fresh and easy the simple way to describe the store is its like trader joes only fresh and easy has a modern feel to it instead of the hippie coop atmosphere for being a relatively small store it carries a very good selection at very reasonable prices the thing theyre best known for is the prepared meals that are relatively healthy and only take minutes to heat up one of their best features is their reduced priced on perishable foods almost everyday you can get a great deal on steak beef chicken or fish thats a day away from its pull date as long as youre not picky its well worth it the biggest problem i have is with their produce for a place with fresh in its title ive notice that fruits and vegetables i buy from fresh and easy tend to expire pretty fast
__label__1 contemporary atmosphere good range of italian offerings attentive wait staff portions generous price reasonable food fine id go again
__label__1 ok so really how can you go wrong with burgers i guess its a just little absurd to me that people dress up to eat a burger or that people choose to drink a glass of pricey wine instead of say a root beer float with their burger speaking of which their rootbeer float is too pricey for what you get at any rate i took my brother to eat here once upon a time for kicks and giggles see what all the hype is about we were actually seated really quickly on a busy night and quickly ordered our burgers they were good that goes without saying and i really enjoyed the decor and the fries in the mini shopping cart yes something so ridiculous it is adorable i dont really like having to order fries separate because i think they should just come with your burger but i digress the burgers were juicy came out fast and piping hot cooked to our specifications and surprisingly not too much more expensive than my childhood fave red robbins ok fine at least their fries had yummalicious dipping sauces id go again just not on a busy night and maybe id dress up a little more but then id feel crazy like why am i wearing a dress to eat a burger but i do like those fancyschmancy burgers i guess i can suck it up
__label__1 i absolutely love this little spot its a great little known boutique with incredibly unique gift items that i dont have to drive clear out to scottsdale to find ive been shopping at vignettes for about 8 years whenever i am in a quandary about what to get someone this is the first place that i head to mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand whether its something for the garden a gift for the new bride or baby a unique piece of art or heavenly scented candles you will not be disappointed the owners staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion need and they do the most amazing wrap jobs making gift giving even easier the final bonus is their annual clearance sale for three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it
__label__1 dave at daves ashtanga is the best yoga teacher he is kind considerate patient and a very nice person he will take the time to show you a yoga move or asana he is very knowledgeable about different subjects what i like best is once he said here you can do nothing wrong
__label__1 during my fiveday stay in tempephoenix i honestly did not have a single bad meal every restaurant and coffee joint i stopped at gave me great experiences i wanted to end my trip out to arizona with a good dinner and i found myself at dos gringos to hopefully find that last meal out west honestly the name sold me pretty quickly obviously im not going to expect fine cuisine and classy dining at a place called dos gringos but being a fan of dives and being one with my fellow man it sounded like a good place to experience despite it being chilly at night now this time of year it was still an experience upon arrival its like the tacky somewhat tasteless lampooned mexican version of tgi fridays with a whole bunch of crap all over the walls and a whole lot of handpainted placards with sayings that make all of our inner14yearolds chuckle and appreciate the parking was free and plentiful and im always a fan of the grungy christmas lights hanging all over the place kind of decor my kind of style for relaxation and nononsense there were tvs everywhere which was nice to watch some sunday night football in the process and i sat wherever i pleased service was from a cute petite blond waitress who was quick to take my order deliver my beer and bring my food when it was ready i ordered an enchilada and two street tacos which were corn tortilla apparently dont take my word for it being an uneducated in mexican food east coaster but i thought it was great definitely different than the kind of mexican food i can get in atlanta overall i cant say that i had a bad experience the food was filling not really expensive and tasty to my tastebuds beer football on a mild evening in a place full of 56 pieces of tacky mexican flair and a waitress with a great smile and i cant complain solid adequate way to end my dining binging throughout the phoenixtempe area
__label__1 mini burgers arent a new idea or anything but i have a habit of showing up to a restaurant starving and over ordering so if a place can take care of the portion control for me im pretty pleased the food is great normally i get a buffalo burger with sweet potato fries and sometimes ill toss in a sloppy joe for sentimental reasons but the bartender marshal has got to be one of my favorite parts always friendly comfortable place thats great for happy hour or as a stop during your normal old town rotation
__label__0 where are the managers it took 1 12 hours for our meal to come out at 815 in the evening items came out at different times so we couldnt all eat at the same time the asparagus tempura was inedible because they didnt cut the ends waitress just took it away and did not comp us waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu she sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables food was way over priced and i couldnt speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud one of the worst dining experiences in a long time paid 70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry horrible
__label__1 some of the best pizza ive had in phoenix i prefer to get takeout since the inside is a littleeh but who cares if the foods good i love the crust crispy and slightly chewy the pizza can be a little greasy sometimes but hey its pizza but as long as it doesnt soak through and make the crust all flimsy which has never happened with the pizzas i get here its nothing that a paper towel or two cant fix im not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says theyre pretty good the staff has always been superfriendly and they actually remember me even though i only come in once every couple months
__label__0 why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me parking is freaking ridiculous at least i have been enough times to know to leave my car on mill and walk your security people are a bunch of freaking jerks who take their power wayyyy to seriously take off my shoes what kind of weapon or drugs can i be hiding in my open toed 2 inch heels your sound sucks seriously sucks for all the fees you charge on top of tickets buy some new speakers already the bathrooms are gross drinks are reasonable so you get 2 stars watch out for the glass walls leading to the patio if you have overindulged in booze ive heard they are easy to run in to
__label__1 sadly my mom fell down a wet grassy hill walking her dog on monday night and broke her ankle in two places ouch she was rushed to scottsdale healthcare north in an ambulance and texted me on the way to alert me of her injury lets just say i hopped in the car without blinking and drove up to scottsdale from tucson as quickly and safely as possible when i first arrived at the hospital she was in a very small room directly off of the er waiting room seriously i thought this was a closet no joke jay the rn came in several times to check her blood pressure take her to get xrays etc you knowthe typical hospital drill when you break your ankle anyhoo he was so kind gentle and had my mom in stitches no pun intended ha with his witty jokes i could tell my mom thoroughly enjoyed his company and care he was so wonderful and really helped take the pressure off of what was going to happen nextsurgery shout out to jayyou are awesome and thank you so much for going above and beyond to take such great care of my mom after five long hours of being in the er my mom was moved to her own room on the orthopedic floorfinally side note all rooms at scottsdale healthcare north are single room occupancy this is such a fabulous accommodation that means no fighting over the remote or loud snores coming from the other patientyay for mom at this point i knew this was going to be a long night and an extensive journey we arrived at her room on the 5h floor and were pleasantly surprised by the immediate welcoming of the evening nurses they quickly got her settled into her room and made sure she was comfy the room was small but super clean so no complaints there a little while later we were told that my mom was going to have surgery sometime in the early morning but didnt have a confirmed time lets just say we both too tired to care because by now it was going on 2am i left the hospital and headed to my moms house for a few hours of sleep before i returned in the morning for her pending surgery got there around 8ish and still no surgery time ok at this point my only complaint was the waiting and the unidentified time of her surgery this seriously went on all day until finally at 6pm she was wheeled down to preop again more waiting as the anesthesiologist had a crisis situation with another patient at this time i was fortunate enough to meet dr nelson who was performing the surgery on her ankle my impression of dr nelson was that he was very warm compassionate and informative he asked for my phone number and said he would call me directly after moms surgery with an updateand he did an hour or so later my mom arrived back at her room from recovery all went well and it was time for sleep i returned the following day wednesday and waited her release ugh more waiting my mom was finally released wednesday evening around 8pm with no problems or issues yay we are going home overall the experience at scottsdale healthcare north was pleasant and satisfying and im so thankful for their excellent and professional care with my mom the doctors nurses physical therapists and aids were amazing caring and extremely helpful you can really tell these people are passionate about their job fabulous job scottsdale healthcare north oh one more thing note to mom no more slipping down wet grassy hills
__label__1 hmmdidnt love it didnt hate it i was indifferent i like the decor and if i could give it a half a star just for having an outdoor dining area i would the menu left a lot to be desired for me we went at lunch time so i dont know what the dinner menu looks like it was just ok nothing blew me away its nice for people watching and has a really nice location
__label__1 a bit pricey yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find parking is slim
__label__0 ok let me be straight with you i hate paying full price for anything yes im one of those people i love a coupon i love a discount and i absolutely love a bargain but i dont like to feel dirty when i leave a store i felt really really dirty when i left this store ewwwwww this is a yucky ross dirty dirty dirty the floors and clothing racks were filthy i couldnt have bought something even if i wanted to because the store was so gross i got black stuff on my hand after touching a clothing rack the floor was so discolored im not sure what the original color was parts of the stores floor were sticky many of the clothes had indistinguishable marks on them presumably from the dirty hangars and racks they are stored on selection was meager there wasnt a single shoe bag wallet sock or home decor item that caught my eye the trip was a waste of an hour that ill never get back never ever again
__label__1 so going on vacation in a week and wanted to get a brazilian for the first time i gotta say the technician christine was great she tells you what to expect and tosses in a little humor to keep you comfortable it was very clean the wax isnt to hot and the technician never double dipped i found the place very clean and comfortable pricing is just right too i like that there are options to buy it for a year and go anywhere they have a shop i did get told about product as others reviewed however i didnt feel pushed because christine explained how it can be used and why in addition she told me of other uses for the product it was an all around good experience that i would recommend to any friend wanting to get waxed
__label__1 great eats at this joint new york strip was awesome pear salad was bomb and service was superb ill be back march 10th
__label__1 stonecreek is a nice place to play and the price is fair i do like the layout fun but not gimmicky the scenery is nice too i will have to agree with others about the ball vacuum aka creek running right through the middle of the course the staff also seemed nice enough when i was there im not sure what others were complaining about overall its a decent place to play and its location makes it ideal if youre meeting people from the other side of town
__label__0 we were so disappointed we were on vacation in scottsdale and wanted to try a brazilian restaurant it was nothing like the one we have had home actually it was completely worse than all three brazilian steakhouses we have close to home i tried about 12 different meats and i think there were only 2 out of the 12 that were tender the rest were over cooked or hard as a rock we really wanted to love this place as i kept trying more and more of the meats as they came around hoping the next one would be better besides being hard the meats didnt have much flavor the salad bar was okay and i dont know that i would even pay the cheaper price to just eat from their salad bar this is sad that i have to say the highlight or our meal was the fresh bread and salami slice you get at the salad bar
__label__1 i absolutely love love love the ambiance and decor of modern steak its beautiful came for arizona restaurant week 2010 i would have never ever picked this restaurant based on its name i do not eat steak nor will i ever eat steak but my friend wanted to go so i agreed since there were nonsteak items on the restaurant week menu im so happy we did for the first course i debated between the crispy shrimp and the chopped salad and based on the waiters recommendation i ordered the chopped salad with avocado crispy vegetables and parmesan loved the huge chunks of avocado in it for the second course i ordered the tortelli a version of tortellini it was the perfect size not too big not too small enough for one person it was delicious it was stuffed with artichoke and cheese and was heavenly i wish i had the recipe so i could attempt to make it at home the dessert of peanut butter cup was equally delicious its not what youd expect it to be its smooth and creamy with a hint of chocolate but its damn good i was so full from my meal and couldnt finish all of it so i asked the waiter to scoop it out into a togo box for me and he laughed but happily packed it up i didnt wanna waste any of that peanut butter goodness im so surprised in modern steak im glad i gave it a chance despite its namesake ill definitely go back and tell all my friends about it too
__label__0 fine for an overnight at the airport not a vacation destination needs a full restoration breakfast included
__label__1 ill preface this review by saying that ive never been a fan of hospitals my experience with hospitals growing up was always to visit friends or relatives that were sick or recovering from accidents and ive never felt 100 comfortable at the site of blood dealing with disease or scary situations for these reasons i really respect doctors nurses and all of the staff that work at hospitals to help those in need on a daily basis all of that being said ive seen my fair share of emergency rooms in the last few years and for the most part ive had decent experiences even as the patient ive actually been to this scottsdale healthcare location three times already in the past eight months twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class this is the hospital where my obgyn delivers so naturally this is where ill be heading when baby mess is ready to enter the world and im confident that ill be in good hands when the time comes ive heard great things about the facility itself especially the labordelivery area from other friends that have delivered here and from my experience to date the staff has always been great as well parking can be tricky but they do offer complimentary parking during the week and the breastfeeding class i took was very informative bottom line i dont think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of fun places to hangout but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help a hospital is needed you cant go wrong with scottsdale healthcare fingers crossed ill still feel this same way after i deliver this baby
__label__1 i used to work here so it had to be good honestly i would say it is the most friendly place i had been to cashiers are willing to except all coupons and work with their customers the prices are great and the gas rewards system is very useful i just wish it was a marketplace instead
__label__1 ive been here a couple of times when i was in college and once or twice since ive graduated a memorable time while in college was my friends 21st bday on a thursday night i came here on a party bus with some people including some guy from the real world and they had a fountain of champagne with strawberries all you can drink is definitely a bad idea for me because i felt the wrath and had to call into work the next day but it was a whole lot of fun recently i came here with my bf and some friends and i must say i had a great time i was happy to have a little more than annoying house music all night they played a wide variety of music that was fun to dance to i also loved the pussycat dancer that dances above the dj its pretty cool when the two way mirror reveals a bed and sexy burlesque dancer the bartenders are pretty cool and i didnt have to wait very long to get service i think pcl is a decent bar based on my experiences
__label__1 we drive a little out of the way to go this target because its clean and is surrounded but many other stores we frequent its usually pretty busy so plan to park a bit further than most
__label__0 theres 1 casino my tia wont go to but she doesnt remember the name of it guess what i think this is the place i thought wild horse pass casino was already open no not until oct 30 i think wild horse needs to reword their billboards so we drove a few minutes down and ended up at gila river casino next time ill pass super small lame security and the machines suck literally the machines inhale your money like its water i spent 50 within 3 mins without winning anything what made me scratch my head was the set up of the machines youll see a row of 25 cent machines then a random 500 machine in the middle of it or a row of 100 machines and a random 2500 machine thrown into it what the heck again ill pass on gila river
__label__0 i was searching for a unique item to give as a thank you gift and i stopped by practical art over the labor day weekend after viewing some items on their website i was extremely under underwhelmed by the service i received and do not plan on returning when i arrived the young woman behind the counter was having a personal conversation with an acquaintance besides the employee and her conversation buddy the store was empty i spent about ten minutes looking around and the young woman did not have the common courtesy to acknowledge me with a simple hello even as i was viewing items directly in front of the counter when i was leaving the store she did break long enough to say bye i believe it is very important to support local business but i will not spend my money here i did find several items i wanted to buy and made note of the artist i have done the extra leg work to reach out to them to find out how to purchase their items through other channels i do not feel they should miss a sale due to the sub par customer service at this location
__label__1 i love harkins theaters in general but this one simply doesnt seem to be kept up as well as most its a little dingy the bathrooms arent typically in great shape the screens themselves are good sizes and the chairs really are comfy but the concession stand dosent seem as clean as it should be and it typically has the movie theater sticky floor going on harkins az mills really is aok but there are enough other theater choices that i typically make this one my la
__label__1 ummmmmmmmcan i just say that this place needs to get more action the pizzas here are fantastic i discovered this place because it opened above sacks it is around the corner from my house and i am so thankful it is the whole restaurant is openi wish it had a little more space but that is ok first the tuscan pie is to die for it has prosciutto gorgonzola apple arugula a fig marmalade and balsalmic vingerette reduction sauce drizzled on topat least i think that is what it isi need to check the menubut anyways its fabulous i wish i could eat it everyday i tried their moroccan pizza before they took it off the menu and it was awesome too every single salad is great and the wine and beer selection is great too the staff is so nice and friendly i get this to go all the time and bring it homeand i have shared this with my friends too i love good italian pizza and its great
__label__1 dr norton and his staff are friendly and professional they have made my 3 children feel relaxed and comfortable i highly recommend this office
__label__0 i had smashburger for the first time a couple of days ago and i was not impressed my burger was way too greasy the smashfries were good but they were greasy as well im not expecting for my burger to be dry but there is a major difference between juicy and greasy and they crossed over into the land of the grease and they were heavy handed with the salt unless i want my sodium intake for the week in 1 day i would suggest that they move away from the salt they are similar to five guys in that they have no combos but they have more options i can see what the appeal is and maybe the cook was having a bad day but between the grease and the salt i will not be going back unless i have a death wish
__label__1 you are seeing a continuing trend here when it first opened it was a 5 star place but since then the pizza has been inconsistent and going down hill the last pizza i ordered the crust was soggy and it had too much yeast the cheese was also too rubbery and tasteless i grew up watching 90210 like many of us old folks they had the peach pit do you remember that place well jimmy and joes is the pizza version of the peach pit yes me and my 30s felt age inappropriate when i arrived and i immediately felt like i was in high school again when i went to grab a tiny ketchup cup to grab some wing sauce and they said it was 60 cents another person walked in and they gave him a hard time because he didnt have his coupon on him even though he read the coupon code over the phone it had that high school vibeyou know the one im talking about thei owe you 3 dollars and ill pay you back tomorrow vibe that vibe is felt when you park there there is limited parking as it is and whatever parking they have there are signs that limit you to 20 minutes parking almost implying they dont want you to eat there i was too afraid to take napkins because im sure it had some price or limitation attached just like everything else there ive eaten here several times and ive reached this conclusion eat at the place but dont pick up pizza here jj specializes in the one slice and drink their short slices are done well and if you dont eat it hot when it comes right out of the oven it loses its flavor fast ive picked up pizza and its almost like two different pizzas when i picked it up the cheese was exrtremely rubbery and the crust was so chewy like steak this is a great place for a short lunch or a business lunch but i wouldnt order several pies if i was hosting a superbowl party or had people over
__label__1 i had been wanting to come back for a while i love this restaurant last night we had a magnificent meal i started with the st francis lemonade a perfect cocktail to start your meal there are so many wonderful choices they are featuring a special menu for new years however you can order from it a la carte so we decided to start with the arizona citrus salad it was delicious i love the combination of dates goat cheese and orange slices i also chose from the special menu the sea scallops wow they were so sweet and tender they were served over a bed of black lentils so amazing the portion was generous 5 scallops i am glad i didnt order the side of sweet corn polenta i ended up ordering dessert yes my hubby twisted my arm not i had the usual sticky toffee pudding and my hubby had the chocolate stout cake i had a bite of his and it was great i cannot guarantee i wont stick to my usual dessert but it was a closed one i wish this restaurant was closer to where i live it is such a great place
__label__1 off the chaincos lol today my friends and i pondered what to eat a good sandwich was was we decided on but where looked right here on yelp and it came up most the reviews were good so we went for it wow i like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak with peppers and mushroom i went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish he handed me a sample of the tortalini and i was in heaven service was polite the place was busy but not crowded it was clean and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order took about 10 minutes to arrive not bad i thought the price was fair and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling while eating my buddy joked the place was off the chain and should rename itself to off the chaincos lol highly recommended and cant wait to take others here shawn
__label__1 this is the best venue in the valley for what is intended to be a midsize venue that attracts national touring acts with a standing room only intimacy that you wont get at a place bigger or smaller i saw clutch here recently and it rocked my balls off i didnt drink at the place took care of that before and after so i cant comment on drink prices parking did suck but there was a structure across the street for five bucks one downside going to the website to check out upcoming shows is tedious the calendar is soooo hard to sort through i would only go there to get more info on opening bands not listed on ticketmastercom
__label__1 old town tortilla factory does a fantastic job with mexicannew mexican cuisine the chicken pinwheels that were supposedly featured on the food network or something are phenomenal theres a good variety of entrees featuring different types of seafood and meat and plenty of southwest flavors the margaritas served with a little shaker of extra are excellent too my mom actually drank a whole one which maybe you dont know my mom but trust me is saying something the ambiance out on the patio when its not too hot outside is quite comfortable and cozy with the fountain and the strings of lights also they have homemade flavored tortillas with different flavors featured daily but sometimes the waitstaff doesnt seem overly eager to give them out had to deduct one star for service other than that i highly recommend this place
__label__1 i went to susies for lunch the other day i got it to go as i was alone and dont like to eat at restaurants by myself there was only a few people inside and the food seemed to come pretty fast if you eat in i probably waited about 20 mins for my to go food i thought the restaurant was in need of a remodel but they dont seem like they have the greatest hours as they close at 5pm so it is a lunch place not a dinner place i got my food and took it home i live not even a mile from this place i ordered sopes they had shredded beef lettuce cheese tomatoes and salsa i thought they were very comparable to the ones i have had before which were homemade i would like to go back for lunch but as im not home much for lunch it might be difficult definitely worth a second chance
__label__0 we had lunch here with the inlaws today highlights the wait staff is awesome fast friendly fun everyone here is on it lowlights the food its not terrible but kind of meets expectations of a diner in a strip mall weak coffee white bread smaller portions nothing was particularly great nothing really sucked but was just mediocre they must be doing something right it was crowded and my inlaws like it id rather go without eating than visit here again
__label__1 the interior is very industrial and charming furnished with iron beams brick walls and simple hanging lightbulbs the lobby area has special imported drinks and other trinkets there is always a line but it usually goes pretty quick because youre distracted by all of their deserts and miscellaneous goodies on display ive never had a meal that wasnt awesome here i usually find myself eating the simple but delicious liberty joe with their special spicy sauce and then finishing the meal off with a homemade snickerdoodle whatever you end up ordering im sure youll end up enjoying liberty market as greatly and as frequently as i do
__label__1 i had my first experience with matts this morning a friend of mine had seen it on diners dives and drive ins or something along those lines and was excited to try it out the wait was about 20 minutesarrived at 9 am and seating is very limited but worth it im all about the breakfast food so i was excited to try somewhere new the menu is limited but covers all bases the coffee a special blend just for them is local as is everything that they serve i swear the bacon tastes better when its from around the corner i decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns super yummy i appreciate the note on the menu that they only use butter and extra virgin olive oil no trans fats here the hash browns were a bit oily but tasty overall as i was leaving i saw a huge stack of pancakes on their way to a table i know what im getting next time
__label__1 i come here probably at least once a week the prices are right theres a good variety of ethnic food the cashiers are quick and friendly and theyre just helpful i locked myself out of my car when having a spacecadet moment and they let me use their phone to call aaa to bail me out fresh flowers great selection of wine and cheese all the essentials they deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they dont have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible go tjs
__label__1 beware the latte otherwise this is a typical circle k come to think of it the latte is probably typical of circle k as well
__label__1 i go to debon every 3 weeks for aki the hairdresser shes very nice and asks you a lot of quesitons to make sure you get what you want she is reasonably priced
__label__1 ive been here three times once for lunch and twice for dinner lunch was pretty crowded dinner not so much but tons of take out prices are cheap and food is good i love the beans and i recently tried the guacamole and loved it try it out and see for yourself
__label__1 my husband got back today from new jersey what a relief he isnt stuck in hurricane irenes path anymore and since we were in the neighborhood we figured wed go to over easy read my most recent review on how that went ie a bust we stopped at starbucks at the safeway next to over easy and got our kids a pastry each while we figured out what wed do i turned to trusty yelp on my droid and they said that not only was taylors cafe open they do breakfast and they were only about a mile from where we were we decided to give breakfast one more try called taylors and put our names on the list when we arrived it was a little hard to find but we called and they told us where it is the decor is cozy and inviting we waited at the bar for a few minutes while a table was readied the manager was very attentive i told him what happened at over easy and he was horrified we live in avondale were willing to drive for a good breakfast and also pay a bit more for good food and good service let me tell you taylors cafe really turned the morning around for us my kids each ordered an apple juice and one got chocolate chip pancakes the other got strawberry waffles their kids menu is 8 each but the portions are huge its easily something an adult would put away i stole a bite from each they were very tasty and there was enough for doggie bags my husband got a build your own omelet with 3 different cheeses and chicken sausage with his omelet he got 2 choices for sides so he chose hash browns and cottage cheese he almost went with a bagel but was pleased to hear about the cottage cheese the chicken sausage was an interesting option that we had not expected he also ordered a mocha which at 4 was about the size of what youd get at starbucks and my husband said that it was on par with their quality i ordered the joes special intrigued by the list of ingredients it was flavorful and delicious the country potatoes were very tasty i ordered the homemade raspberry lemonade it was tangy and sweet really tasty on a hot summer day we came to the decision on 4 stars because the food was good but not out of this world they have fantastic options for the health conscious and it seems to be popular with the patrons of a local gym because there were tons of people coming in work out gear there is plenty of space you dont feel like sardines in a can the staff is polite competent and professional and the ambiance is nice we will definitely be coming back
__label__1 im not normally a big fan of italian food but after marching six miles against 1070 in the memorial day weekend heat i decided it was time to slang my groupon on the table and carb it up and fortunately this was my favorite groupon find yet aiellos is in a beautiful building i dont think a building has ever detracted from my eating experience but in cases like aiellos the wonderful shaded verdant patio set the mood in all the right ways the inside is lowkey family restaurant with a dash of romance nice lighting not too loud cool bar the food was awesome delicious probably housemade pasta with simple flavors that let the sauces and vegetables sing an exhaustive but not daunting wine list though itd be nice to see more options served bytheglass as icing on the cake at the end of the meal you get to play a game that might let you get your meal for free i wont ruin the surprise but it adds a lot of character if i had an italian grandmother this is the sort of food id expect shed make highly recommended for a date night classic dinnerandamovie style for unpretentious delicious fare
__label__1 dear lolos why do you have to be so damn good i really wish that when i had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that i wouldnt have to come back and eat fried chicken and waffles again but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouthwatering juicy breasts thighs woah where is this going lol thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work truly wonderful i never had waffles with fried chicken before and im not sure why i was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but i was great service everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a plus i love you lolos
__label__1 pretty good food place is funky werent many people in there for a saturday lunch especially considering the proximity to asu but the service was decent and the food was good very inexpensive 2 lunches and drinks for 15 ill stop by again when im out that way
__label__1 great food the fez burger is a real winner the staff and clientele are friendly great place to meet people for drinks and hang out
__label__1 possibly the best pho soup i have ever had i cant believe i ate the whole thing wellyes i can actually what clinched it for me was that i ordered it to go which is almost never a good idea when it comes to the pho do not attempt to assemble at your desk i repeat do not assemble at your desk but everything was securely packaged and wellpresented plenty of everything noodles meat herbs sauce jalapenos etc and oh so tasty ive got my sights set on the bbq pork rice noodle bowls for my next visit which will be soon go get your pho on
__label__1 ive been here a couple times and from reading other reviews i must have come on a good night both times i was here we sat on the patio and really enjoyed the atmosphere they have a large rock pit in the middle that they light when its cold for heat i really love the mussels in the white sauce here and last time i also had the spinach salad it was delicious fresh and served with the perfect amount of bacon vinaigrette the service is good nothing special but what is with the waitresses wearing flip flops i just dont see how that is sanitary especially if theyre walking in the kitchen overall it was good and im sure ill be back i keep meaning to come for happy hour when they have 12 price appetizers a bowl of mussels and a glass of sauvignon blanc is all i need for an inexpensive and tasty dinner
__label__1 standing like a paragon of virtue in a sea of decadence us eggs scottsdales location is place of redemption both for your soul and your appetite open only for breakfast and lunch the restaurant attracts as diverse a clientele as the dale itself this is not somewhere that relies on being a tourist trap some locals are known to eat here daily its location is slightly outside the old town pale but still within walking distance unless its the height of summer secondly it has its own parking lot making it as accessible as dennys or a marie callendars nevertheless the lot is often full on weekend mornings and you will definitely see people waiting unless you arrive very early or late there is both an outdoor patio seating area and a large indoor dining room having gone numerous times alone i am always impressed how quickly i am seated no bias against tables for one here the servers are all personable and gracefulyet not selfaggrandizing this is not a michelin fourstar restaurant however and you should not expect being waited on hand and foot given the volume of service its also commendable how few mistakes are made and how prompt everything is the food is also excellent although you can order both lunch or breakfast i tend to crave the latter more theres plenty of variety on the menu and they have both innovative dishes and old staples this helps to explain why the uberfab scottsdale club kids patronize this place just as much as the cadillac set prices are very reasonable for scottsdale though perhaps too much for a dirtpoor college student or person living only on social security the building also capitalizes on arizonas sunny weather with high ceilings and plenty of windowscausing plenty of light to splash in and helping to evoke that sense of morning and freshness theres plenty of ambient noise as a resultbut its almost reassuring not to mention that the hearingaid crowd and club crawlers may be too deaf to notice us egg is not flawless however from a cost point of view the restaurant has to contend with the fact that breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day without a dinner menu though to recoup cost diners have to grin and bear any perceived cost imbalance from say dennys neverthless its still worth it in my opinion the other shortcoming stems from the food different dishes often rely on the same sides if you get sick of their potatoes for example you can be really out of luck despite ordering something different every time moreover their signature dishes again may not impress truly demandng foodies while it may not cure your hangover or incontinence us egg remains firmly on the map for locals managing to please all of scottsdale is a tall order and the owners managers and staff all should stand tall and be proud
__label__1 there are few places that are delicious hole in the wall chains in fact there really are no hole in the wall chains except two hippies and they do it right upon entering two hippies you will see all kinds of crazy decor like a twister mat on the ceiling chairs on the ceiling etc your food options consist of burgers hot dogs and tacos where as your beverage choices consist of regular stuff like various sodas to flavored tea and lemonade the flavored tea and lemonade is amazing the flavor in the flavored teas is so good you dont even need to add sweetener thats impressive the food is equally as delicious i had 2 tacos one was fish not fried baked tilapia so good and healthier and green beef they have a red beef and green both are cooked with different peppers and marinades the green beef was amazing im def looking forward to trying the red beef as well as the cactus taco which is just insane sounding two thumbs up bring cash though because thats all they take
__label__1 ive been to other pei weis in the valley and ive yet to see any as busy as this one the food is consistently good do expect about a 20 minute wait for food if you are dining in they recently got the new coke touch machines where you can make your own flavor combo yum this place can get noisy i wouldnt recommend bringing kids since this place is very hectic and can be overwhelming to small children take out is stellar and most of the time food is ready when promised
__label__1 i love tasty kabob their food is always excellent and i try to make it back there whenever i return to the valley i always order their chicken shish kabob entree which comes in a generous portion that includes rice and grilled vegetables the chicken is always tender wellmarinated and equally wellseasoned their beef shish kabob entree is also very good try shaking a little sumac spice onto the rice and meat for some extra flavor or just enjoy it as is its difficult to choose from their list of appetizers and side dishes but their hummus is always creamy and smooth and i love their shirazi salad their spicy beans dish however is by far my personal favorite and i always make sure to order it just as important as the food is the friendly service i encounter whenever i visit the couple who own the restaurant always make you feel welcome good food and service that makes you feel at home what more can you ask for simply put tasty kabob is one of the best
__label__0 i work right across the street and a few of us went here for lunch one afternoon i ordered a salad to go as soon as i saw the guy grab shredded sandwich lettuce to make my salad i almost told him to stop but i didnt i regreted it when i started to dig in and realized the lettuce was brown and yellow very disappointed 6 bucks for nasty lettuce tomatoes and green peppers i ordered a salad thinking i was getting something like the picture on their website i wont be returning here ill be passing on lunch next time the coworkers opt for this place
__label__1 every friday my dad and i eat here we order the same thing pizza wraps they are good and fillng iced tea hits the spot typical strip mall pizza
__label__1 ive been to the locations in chandler and mesa and one word describes both locations fresh their donuts are consistently soft and fresh
__label__1 its pei wei the service and food are always satisfactory
__label__1 amazing facility scottsdale healthcare has done a great job the people are happy to work here unlike some hospitals they are very receptive and the er operates like clockwork
__label__1 ive been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and i was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past saturday we finally woke up early enough on a saturday morning to hit up matts and then peruse the market before it got too hot we made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors he had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and i decided to try the key lime i was amazed at how natural it tasted there was nothing artificial about it it just tasted exactly like it should these are very good very simple cheesecakes i ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty there are a bunch of different sizes to choose from all at very fair prices yummy
__label__1 first time in this restaurant it is next to golds gym on the ne of northsite and raintree dr it is similar to chipotle but the pinto beans are better tasting the chicken is all white meat the employees are very friendly and will take the time to chat with you they learn what you like if you are a regular and will just confirm that there arent any changes burritos tacos and salads are the main items to choose from this is a very good spot to eat and enjoy the food the soft drinks are not watered down like most other places are now a days enjoy i will oh they have a card that you buy 10 and the next purchase is free
__label__0 eh 25 stars maybe 3 not sure yet after looking at the menu online i really wanted to like this place the menu has some creativity to it unlike the templatenorthindianrestaurantmenus you find at many of the indian restaurants in the valley aside from offering things like korma kadai vindaloo etc with a variety of options chicken lamb paneer shrimp or fish for each they also have some other more unusual choices like one of my favorite dishes mattar malai methi creamy fenugreek and peas and dahi vada in the appetizers i couldnt wait to check it out unfortunately three friends and i went at lunchtime on a saturday and there was a buffet so i didnt get to try any of those tempting dishes the restaurant itself while decorated a little haphazardly chinese paintings is bright and clean theres a tv on a wall which happened to be playing one of my favorite bollywood moviesso i was still excited about the place butafter tasting the foodmeh the buffet was all right but nothing to write home about pluses once again it had something differentfish curry as well as an indianstyle chinese dish or two so that was cool but the food was just soso i was there fwith three other people one of them said the cuts of meat especially the chicken were of higher quality than most indian buffets but he didnt like the sauces so much one other friend said he liked the tikka masala but that was about it as for the vegetarians well we didnt have a lot of choices veggie manchurian which was pretty good a very bland chana masala and some peacarrot thing that reminded me more of baby food than anything else the dessert was just all right too and the rice was very bland so overall i wasnt impressed but i dont want to judge the place too harshly based just on the buffet after all curry house was packed on a saturday afternoon so im thinking maybe its got something better to offer me ill have to go back for dinner and see what their nonbuffet selections taste like before i totally write this place off my list
__label__0 i went here because all my friends were peeing their pants about how good it is wrong the slow perhaps retarted staff with no customer service alongside the barely mediocre tasting pizza both contributed to my disdain for this awful eatery fuck itstick to slices
__label__1 i had the fruits of the forest flavor and really enjoyed it staff was very helpful will definitely be coming back
__label__1 the shopping center this rack is located in is absolute poison to my pocketbook tj maxx ross and nordstrom rack all in a tidy row rock on there are great deals to be found here with patient and selective hunting like any other discount retailer and that these great deals are on brands which nordstroms carries makes any awesome deal so very much sweeter dont go expecting to strike gold at every visit or expecting ross prices on guess shoes and you will fall in love with the store
__label__1 the place was pretty empty even for an off night the service was pretty decent but like i said it was empty ive been in here a few times but never when its busy the prices dont impress me but id say you get a pretty decent pour for the money one thing id like to point out a 15l bottle of dom is less than 1000 bucks but a 30l bottle of dom is 3500 if youre a fucking idiot get the 3l if youre a smart shopper youll get two 15l bottles or else just by the glass which works out even cheaper just so you know it works the opposite way costco does if youre getting a big ass bottle of dom anyway you probably dont care the decor is red its very dark in here at night dark and loungy rather than clubby similar to merc bar but not as hip or hidden even though they try to hide it with curtains its also pleasantly quiet in here easy to have conversations with the patio door open youre going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if youre sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there its a nice bar but i dont know that id single it out as a place to be i actually think the mondrian is pretty nice but thats based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people i was with at the time if someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party the mondrian is one of a handful of hotels id suggest not so much because of red bar but more because its conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in downtown
__label__1 great little hole in the wall with authentic new mexican food chili relleno was awesome and the red and green chile was flavorful and spicy rice and beans were good and the sopapilla was delicious atmosphere was cozy if you want real red and green chile vs sauce this is the place
__label__1 we happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner when i showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me i asked them to put me in first available and they said 1520min and then 45min for a booth ok ill wait our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time we were there for about 10min already thats when she said to us your table inside is ready she walked us right there and we were sat wow that was quick we ordered drinks and food i got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow they were delicious for my main dish i ordered a garlic noodle dish it definitely hit the spot my only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside i wont let that affect the rating though awesome place
__label__1 went there with the wife lots of stuff for the ladies i would lay off making any real purchase here on my own i would of course consult the mrs in regards to what she might like way to tough to try and pick something out in here louis vuitton gucci etc that is the stuff for the ladies to decide on nice place very friendly staff warm and inviting one to buy
__label__1 biggest joanns store great fabric selection clean store good layout different from other joann stores convenient location parking is not too bad employees are friendly restrooms are blah and smell
__label__1 i hate being disappointed by bars bragging about their huge number of taps while i cant dispute that they have 52 beers on tap i can tell you that very few of them are worth drinking and that the prices here are on the ok to high side i would never come back if its not happy hour or late night pricing i asked general questions about not discounted pricing nine dollars for a manhattan made with jack daniels and beers ranging from five to seven dollars if im paying seven bucks for a pint at a sports bar in tempe it had better be something from russian river or a stone anniversary brew and a nine dollar manhattan seems out of place this isnt scottsdale or a hotel bar well the good news thirsty lion is quite lovely inside plenty of seating and dim lights really not a bad place to relax and mellow out plus the food was great everything weve had has been very tasty now its all been off of the happy hour menu but thats the only time ill probably be here the scotch eggs are delicious and my main recommendation im hoping that in time prices will drop a bit and more craft breweries will get represented but aside from the nice interior and spot on happy hour menu thirsty lion just doesnt stand out enough to steal me away from boulders or taste of tops
__label__1 love this place the atmosphere was rather chill and calm we played uno and drank pretty darn good coffee we had a lemon cookie which wasjust right
__label__0 new n scottsdale location baaaaaaad the were 10 staff members milling around and there was no manager on sight 1000 for a mediocre burger with an uncooked tasteless bun not large enough to encompass all the arugula they forgot the sauce which apparently is the main ingredient the upgrades are ridiculous 100 here for cheese on an already well priced burger btw flemings blue cheesebacon burger 6 best in town 500 here for fries cmon and its the same two hispanic guys who dont have any idea about chef inspired food cooking in the kitchen as every other restaurant there is no chef for the price you want to see the chefowner representing especially at a new location and you want competent staff who treats you as 1 and not their conversing with the other staff members as 1 and you want to enjoy what is supposed to be one of the best burgers in town what a disappointment the lack of top down management care and supervision carries through in all elements of the poor experience take a pass
__label__1 i hate food shopping okay that is probably an understatement when i go to a big market i am so overwhelmed and usually end up with a million things i dont need while forgetting the things i do need fresh easy is small but it has most things i need i like that they have meats and chicken that already have seasoning on it and are ready to cook this makes shopping extremely easy i also really like their brand of food especially the pasta i think its some of the best tasting store bought pasta i have had dont go here if you need to buy kitchen supplies like cake pans or cookie sheets they simply have food drinks wine and beer here
__label__0 they have good baked baguettes and the price was 150 last month however raising the price to 2 per roll during the holidays is ridiculous the female cashier was short and unprofessional while i was waiting for the rolls she was rude to the next three customers spending money they need to work on their customer service and i vowed never to go back
__label__0 i went because several people i know raved about the place because im a lapsed vegetarian and im always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible and because im a malt freak and found out they have malteds there i was disappointed and my friend i was with who had been one of sticklers diehard fans said that although it was okay this time the place seems to have gone down hill sticklers wasnt busy at all maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line but although there were alot of workers behind the counter the service was very slow we had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches now my friend has been there when it was jampacked and she said the service then was much quicker we went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier the bread was good crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring its supposed to have swiss provolone and american cheese on it i couldnt even taste the swiss or provolone at all the american over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheezwhiz type im always on the look out for a good malt one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake my chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and i wasnt impressed with the ice cream my buddy liked her vanilla malt though the one thing i did like about sticklers is that they have the small bags of miss vickies chips to buy it used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chipswhich are the best kettle chips ive ever had are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops
__label__1 really delicious breakfast burritos they are true mexicanstyle i get the ham and egg breakfast burrito and it comes with cheese and a fresh tortilla they are inexpensive and really big im so glad i work a mile from this place i go at least once a week
__label__1 how have i not sang scotts praises yet well here i go do you want a place for a good solid stick to your ribs breakfast without being too frou frou scotts is the joint its a jewish deli in the middle of my neighborhood i was so surprised that i hadnt noticed it before chrissy p invited me to join her for breakfast one morning and i was just blown away on my first visit i had the eggs benedict my only complaint was that my eggs were a tad overcooked not runny and i wished for more hollandaise sauce for my second visit i brought my little sis and her bff and we chowed i had the hash mash and we shared an order of the french toast i dont know why i challenged myself to my own personal how much breakfast can you stuff into your stomach contest but i think i won everything was so good there was nothing to complain about i wish i could go to scotts every day for a hearty breakfast the dishes are simple the service is straight forward and i have never walked away hungry i will return very very soon
__label__0 i have never been treated so rudely in a retail establishment ever i went to the shop with my daughter her friend and my nieceall young adults i showed a picture of the project we wanted make to the woman working there and she scoffed at me i noticed she was playing solitaire on her ipadapparently we interrupted her game she then proceeded to tell us that she would have to open the door and turn on the air conditioner because her mother the owner of the store would be back soon and is extremely allergic to fragrance the girls and i had body lotion on this is the desert for crying out loud and not one of us had perfume on then the mother arrived there was a brief conversation behind the curtain and she walk out with a towel over her mouth and nose commenting on having to open the door seriously unfortunately we had picked out some stuff to buy and im sorry that i spent the 68 i could have spent more but the experience was so distasteful that we hurried out if i knew how to give less than 1 star i would it was unbelievable i empathize with the woman and her allergies but the situation could have been handled so much better
__label__1 this is great if you are in a hurry they have slices and salads ready to go above average quality and a nice open space too perfect stop before or after catching a movie next door
__label__1 i must admit im more of a walmart neighborhood market guy due to the economy but i had a great time shopping at ajs every single item on the shelves is of the highest quality for valentines day because im so bad at picking out girly gifts i let my girlfriend go on a shopping spree at the chocolate counter among other thingsid go back once in a while but did grimace at the checkout counter when i forked over 125 for three bags of crapi guess its back to mayonnaise sandwiches at neighborhood market
__label__1 yes this is an awesome toy store huge selection and a friendly knowledgeable staff but the prices yikes i really can appreciate the fact that these are wholesome wellmade toys with a focus on learning rather than supporting the corporate brands and hollywood characters but it is just not practical for your everyday shopping needs i recommend it when you want a special or unusual gift or if you have one of those rare children that wants intellectual stimulation more than to impress their friends with the latest electronic gadget or action figure
__label__1 this place looks cool inside and has a fun vibe first the downsides menu can actually be a little overwhelming you get the impression the staff is overworkedcrazy busy how long does it take to make tea to the point where if there are more than four people ahead of you in line you want to shoot yourself unless you have nowhere to be ever upsides huge selection fairly helpful staff paralyzing indecision thats what theyre there for ambiance coolness factor i need to try the food here
__label__1 i went here on a saturday night and sat outside listening to the band playing in the background it was part of the music under the stars or whatever it called very cool and fun though btw i see a lot of people commenting on how loud it was to all you yelpers take that with a grain of salt its a pizza place near a large family residential area on a weekend what do you expect i guess its an expectation thing by no means is this going to be a quiet candlelit dinner for two its a classy family oriented pizza place we ordered the caesar salad and small pepperoni pizza very well priced and the pizza in my opinion tasted delicious it seems like everybody has some weird opinion on how good pizza is and i guess i have a weird opinion as well here goesthe size of the small is not small it was more like a medium value winningsorry lame charlie sheen pop culture reference anyway it had a faint sweet taste on it which i really like the cheese was good not too much sauce and the pepperonis were very flavorful they were the small kind and they were just great the salad was good salad is salad its hard to mess that up we were helped by an awesome bartenderserver named chandler cool guy really nice he kept us entertained well be back i want to try some kind of meatlovers next time we go there
__label__1 parents please let ur children explore on their own i c parents following their kids around
__label__1 we have been meaning to try the mission for awhile and we were extremely impressed we are selfprofessed foodies good cooks etc lets start with the fact that they seated us promptly at our reservation time and that reservation had only been made that daysurprising because the place was packed alfonso was our waiter and he was awesome and didnt hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner first the margaritas this place knows how to pour and they are fresh the only way we will drink them next there are only 3 places in phoenix that can make good tableside guacamole and this is the best of them alfonso suggested a fried pork bellycola reduction appetizer that i had to be talked into omgheaven and such a complex blend of flavors that the sweet crunchiness of the pork belly can only be described as worth it if you are balking at the issue of pork belly entree we chose the chorizo porchetta and the scallops both were excellent and may i say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt we never waited and yet didnt feel rushed dessert i confess that i read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions and while other reviews loved the selections i wasnt blown away the churros were small and doughy and the milkshake was just to heavysweet after a mealbetter to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream fried bananas didnt excite me either bananas are bananas the pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and autumnlike for a 110 degree day in arizona and did not compliment the latin flavors of the dinner i feel their dessert menu needs to be expanded in a way that compliments their cuisinesome citrus sorbet chocolatewithredchile cake lime cheesecake at any rate i still give them the full monty on stars
__label__1 i recently picked up a few satin flower arrangements for a fund raiser event in spite of having bought a coupon deal for the store the owner rachel was more than willing to give me the best possible pricing and pieces the arrangements were beautiful and she even custom made a couple of them for us the colors and flowers she uses are very well picked and beautifully arranged i highly recommend flora unique
__label__1 pupusas as a hardcore mexican food enthusiast i was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced i am proud to say that i am a huge fan of pupusas now salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a lowkey nice sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food it definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of mesa the restaurant is very similar to a lot of mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in phoenix will be familiar with one room with several tables and a counter with interestinglynamed dishes posted behind it the waitress was very friendly but i will say that knowing a little spanish helped my girlfriend and i both ordered the pupusa combo platter real risky based on other reviews i know i went with pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork cheese and beans she had the chicken as well with carne asada this little dish is fantastic i think next time ill just stick with getting two pupusas because i was extremely full and did not need to add rice and beans to the mix although those were good too the only disappointment was the fact that independence day was on the tv in spanish but the volume was too far down to hear id love to hear the voiceover actor for will smith busting out a bienvenidos a tierra p on a more serious note i look forward to heading back here as soon as possible id love to try the ceviche as its on the best of phoenix list and there are a few other dishes think breakfast that looked intriguing
__label__1 had myself a new york striploin and it was quite good although i do hate paying these kind of prices for steak i really thought the vegetables were more special than the steak but if you compare what kind of quality steak you get here compared to say donovans high quality steakhouse in ca ive got to say that i like the overall package presented at keg steakhouse with respect to the quality and price
__label__1 if you are looking for only raw vegan food this is your place nothing is cooked everyhthing is 100 raw they offer a variety of creative options from appetizers wraps soups pizza and pasta they have freshly squeezed juices smoothies and a variety of different health shots the dessert is yummy as well this is a must try
__label__1 i dont have much time to write this but i do want to say a few things i had four things so far here my friend and i both enjoyed them immensely i paid 16 tip i had the a1 cha gio crispy egg rolls a2 goi cuon thit tom spring rolls to start oh man was this delicious the first thing i loved when i walked in was the ambiance dim lit and let the sun do the lighting very zen if youre into that i felt very comfortable here they had four sauces on the table i have no idea what they are but the one with red pepper flakes and oil the darker one oh wow if you like heat added to whatever youre doing wow this stuff is for you i loved it then i went with the pho tai sirloin soup p2 pho tai wow broth was amazing everything was for me enjoying food means i need a few things first awesome food second ambiance third presentation they had it all i was very impressed by place to the plates dont change a thing i hope your business is very prosperous
__label__1 roast beef sandwich at lunch is literally the best ive had cooked to order had mine rare
__label__1 this subway is one of the cleanest and most efficient subways i have ever been to ive only been in the evenings but i have to say every time i walk in someone is always cleaning something their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck thats what makes this subway so great everything is in its place and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work absolutely i will go here again and i cant say that about many subways unfortunately
__label__0 stopped by one night late only one guy working probably the managerowner based on him being on the phone and looking like he wanted to gtfo dodge attitude and not wearing anything quiznos related like most workers do food subpar its a chain its hard to fuck up but he did there was no care in the making of the sub i pretty much watched him throw it together run it through the toaster tossed some lettuce on and wrap it up i had chips in my hand wanted a meal he didnt ask and just rang it up wo the drink i asked what size cup to grab and he said oh you wanted a drink of course i wanted a fucking drink i just stared at him like wtf man told him to keep his drink cause hed have to re run my card srsly its a chain that gives you all the stuff and training to make a sandwich like the other 1000s of quiznos around the country and you cant do it if you hate customer service dont buy a franchise sandwich shop two stars lucky it isnt one im out
__label__1 im so happy these guys are here i work next door at gangplank and the previous sandwich shop in this location was okay but really started to slide downhill planet sub totally renovated the place looks great breathed new life into it and came out swinging with a diverse and tasty menu you can really tell theyre working hard to make this a great experience and the sandwiches ive tried so far have been excellent look forward to going back soon
__label__1 the noodles are delicious here i had the vegetarian spicy noodle it doesnt come with anything but noodles and the sauce it would be great if they could add some veggies in there though so you chose the type of noodle you want and then the flavor the prices are super cheap and the service is fast the portions are huge and i could have eaten the whole plate if i didnt stop myself i am curious to know if they use msg because it was that hard to stop eating
__label__1 i think its about time i wrote a formal review for this establishment considering i have recently bestowed it as my favorite restaurant thats a big title to carry i often judge mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and gallo blanco passes that test they have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico their chunky guac is delish and summery as they put orange slices in it although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz i think it taste like cheezits their best appetizer is the elote grilled cornonthecob with cheese on it it literally melts in your mouth oh and it doesnt get stuck in your teeth like most cornonthecobs tend to the orange cake is amazing and reminds me of my beloved red velvet except you know orange i love everything about this restaurant salsas food drinks atmosphere prices entertainment on wednesday they just need to get rid of that damn giant ugly silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar
__label__1 in the world of mongolian bbq near my work there are 2 contenders stir fry paradise and ajs mongolian formerly and possibly partially still ycs i prefer stir fry paradise because it has never been incredibly packed and their meat resembles meat and not frozen tubes of meat shavings the small bonus buffet offers more food if you arent crippled by all the food you crammed into your bowl i like the cream cheese wonton triangles they rock the body that rocks the party yeah they are a little pricier if you tack on a soda just drink water and then tweet to the world how progressive and off the grid you are by not being a soda drinker i havent quite gotten my sauce mix down yet but that will come in time thats the beauty of these places if your food is bland then the only person you have to blame is yourself and your lack of sauce mixing artistry
__label__1 very nice place and delicious food
__label__0 we had a mixed experience at happy hour hh and dinner quick summary follows hits food was tasty ambiance was nice misses waitress was never able to bring the last call round of hh she offered no explanation or apology asked if i minded anchovies on my salad i said no but didnt realize there would be an upcharge until the final bill came while in the bathroom observed one of the staff go straight from the stall not the urinal to the kitchen no handwashing not even a pause by the sink buen apetito
__label__0 i had dinner at the thai rama two days ago it wasnt an awful dining experience but im not sure i would go here again my friend and i ordered the egg rolls sorry i dont remember the thai name and they were okay two pieces small but the price was 2 so what did i expect and an average filling something i would expect from frozen egg rolls were both vegetarians and were happy to see a vegetarian section in the menu but were slightly disappointed with the options three of the items included oyster sauce and the other three were either vegetarian fried rice or redgreen curry vegetables i ordered the green curry vegetables medium hot and my friend ordered the red curry vegetables mild and she stressed mild we waited 20 minutes for our dinner to arrive i didnt mind my dish it was waaaaay spicier than medium but i dont mind a little heat the sauce was very runny and the vegetables were soggy and looked they had been sitting in the sauce for quite a while my friend didnt like her dish at all mostly because it was quite spicy for being a mild dish we spent 25 total and im not sure it was worth it the service was slow but the waitresses were very friendly overall i would probably not recommend this restaurant to a friend
__label__1 why oh why cant there be one of these closer to my house i would take them any day over subway their bread is fresh their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin this may sound strange too but every mr goodcents ive been too has the best soda fountain coke okayi said it judge me i do prefer the mr goodcents over in tempe off of 48th street but this one is just as good
__label__1 in here for a sec but everyone seemed to be having a good time live dj and enough room to be who u wanta be on the dance floor there was poker going on in the corner and with a nice sized crowd i liked the bartender chick and she was fast for being the only bartender in there and very nice
__label__1 great atmosphere and food we keep coming back
__label__1 yum the toasted barley app is delicious my boyfriend and i shared the eggplant sandwich and the monk burger both of the sandwiches were outstanding the service was great too we will definitely go back
__label__1 amazing just stopped for snacks had the fake crab rangoons and samosas very good will mos def come back to dine hopefully several times when in town love that they sell diaya in the cooler and other lovely products books and junk foods
__label__1 i ate here last week and i really enjoyed the burger fries and decor in this place ive always thought there is only so much you can do to gussy up a burger and fries the zinburger and double truffle fries with aioli had some unique ingredients and tasted great love the onions caramelized in zinfandel the meat used in the burger is fresh and high quality and they cook it to your specification ya youre going to pay more but for 1520 youre getting a much nicer product than the typical 10 bar burger with fries
__label__1 i dont usually write reviews very often in fact ever but i felt that the 45 stars does not currently reflect my previous sushi experience here first off the service here was really good the waitress was really nice very prompt and courteous and provided the food quickly the food itself was prepared well i usually eat a lot of nigiri and the pieces are ok in amount of fish the rice was packed well and the quality of the fish was good the major downside in my opinion is that its pricier than i expected i wish yelp would provide 25 dollar signs granted i did not come for happy hour which ends relatively early at 5pm i go to a lot of sushi restaurants and for the amount of fish provided i would have expected it to be cheaper also the edamame cost even the miso soup is not complimentary considering the above average price ive been to too many other places that have the same price same quality and provided the necessities for free oh i even forgot that a bowl of white rice for my child was even a charge so the nickel and dime of things i would have expected compounded with the surprisingly above average price i can only say that yen sushi was ok the other two people in my party minus the children also agree
__label__1 the pilgrim represented everything thanksgiving turkey sweet potatoes stuffing and onions all in a crust it was served with a side of cranberry sauce and red wine gravy i loved it its a must try if youre around asu the only thing is that its really small but you should be fine sitting at the bar
__label__1 only went to the downstairs bar but cannot wait to return very cool with the rock and copper features and leather couches we sat at the bar and were served drinks that you pour yourself is this a new trend he gave us little glass bottles of tonic and coke with little spoons to stir our drinks with those little spoons were so cute i was almost tempted to put them in my purse if another couple hadnt been hogging the fireplace the whole time we would have sat there maybe next time well try to food too
__label__1 i visited on jan 19 and ordered the thai basil their signature dish with calamari which had a very unique flavor that was a bit masked by the spiciness im a wimp when it comes to spices and i was overwhelmed by the medium i ordered though the dish was very good it was for a dish dish consisting mostly of vegetables on the scant side for 1195 my friend ordered a curry and it was a sizable portion presented in a clay pot i sneaked a bite and it was very good too the place is comfortable and intimate with booths and tables and the wait staff is very friendly
__label__1 what a find in a strip mall nestled between a bank clothing stores and overnight shipping is giuseppes a family owned and run establishment where byob is the way to go this reminds me of countless small mom and pops back in the city the staff is friendly the portions sizable and the check small to medium in fact i cant believe i havent reviewed this restaurant before whether on a date or with the family ive never had a bad experience in the dozens of times ive been there from the veal parmagian sp to the eggplant from the fettucine to the spaghetti and meatbeals mama mia it is a small venue with very limited outdoors seating during good weather and the locals know about it so it gets pretty packed thursday through sunday the salads and appetizers are delicious as well if this restaurant had been in spinal tap it would get an eleven
__label__1 we went to the farm today for lunch to enjoy a picnic on such an awesome beautiful day i had the tuscan sandwich and it was awesome i had expected it to be good but was surprised at just how enjoyable it really was im sure sitting outside in beautiful surroundings on a perfect day helped with the experience this is the prefect place for lunch on a beautiful day my date was equally impressed so im sure i will be back
__label__1 my sweet hubby brought me here for my bday the other night note this is a scottsdale 5 star otherwise known as a chicago california or new york 4 star rating this may possibly be my favorite restaurant in scottsdale amazing food unpretentious and cozy atmosphere got the steak frites asked for veggies instead of frites and ended up with steak green beans it was excellent we asked for a smooth red wine i had possibly my second best red wine ever we also ordered a scallop appetizer and the escargots both were cooked almost to perfection however lacking in salt for my personal preference which is an easy fix i would definitely go back dont recommend this for large parties however it is the perfect place for smaller intimate parties
__label__1 loooove this place yes its pricey but good sushi usually is the guys making the rolls were friendly the atmosphere is nice hubby absolutely loved the quail eggs and i couldnt get enough of the spicy shrimp roll seriously try it you wont be disappointed
__label__1 my wife and i came here to see what they had to offer as we had bought a king size bed frame and bed however because we can still cancel our order and felt our decision was on the whim as the mattress we originally purchased was on sale from another furniture store we came here to see what other options we had to choose from upon entering i already was prepared for the sales man attack however we were taken back by how friendly and non pressuring environment we entered in george the salesman was very informative on the beds and was trying to gauge what we were looking for after narrowing down to 3 beds another couple came in we told him we can attend to them while we continued to drill down he checked on us a few times and answered a few questions we had but was not breathing down our necks the products they had a good selection of beds for all prices ranges and were well organized based on color piece on the mattress the sales were nice as well as the options in the clearance section which seemed very reasonable in the end we ran to the other furniture store to see the bed we originally purchased which we liked very much and kept our original decision if we didnt find the bed prior mattress firm would have easily won our business and would recommend them to others
__label__1 this is definitely the best place for breakfast in wickenburg loved all the cowboy decorations photos of actors from the early westerns days and the cuckoo clock which didnt cuckoo but instead whinnied like a horse clean premises very friendly staff excellent service and breakfast for the group came out in due time call ahead for groups of more than 4 as most of the booths are small
__label__1 they have the friendliest staff at this whole foods they know me by name and always have samples ready for the little boy i nanny before we even walk up to the deli counter maureen the checker kathy in vitamins and daniel paula in the deli are all exceptional go see them if you need anything they will be happy to help
__label__1 pretty ok place right in the thick of it i saw 3 separate arrests while drinking beer on the patio they have a couple different 4 peaks brews those facts alone made it a successful endeavor did i mention it was 4pm on a friday
__label__1 decent airport with a limited variety of food choices and a strange layout it feels a little outdated but i was only at the airport for a quick layover
__label__0 first off the woman who answers the phone is not impressive at all i called to consign my furniture and when i asked her about some info on the store she said do you want to consign your table or not quite rude that was a turn of for me the next day i went in the store for some info but when i entered i knew this wasnt the right fit for my robb stucky table the place had older style furnituredated couches florals mauves there was one accessory that i would buy in the whole store needless to say i wont be coming back or consigning my table or anything elserude stuff gross stuffwhat more can i say
__label__1 games great game prices decent food edible but nothing to write home about food prices way too high for the quality bar weird the 1st bar ive heard of that doesnt carry baileys or some type of irish cream liqueur drinks meh stick w beer service also weird ive had the best service here when its crazy busy and the absolute worst when my friends and i are the only people to be waited on a good time if youre going for games and basic drinks
__label__1 i have been here countless times since my last review and found myself here for a quick drink and some appetizers last night i took a huge hiatus as i was in michigan for a month and then have been crazy busy since arriving back in phoenix and transitioning into a new job i was sad because i thought they wouldve forgotten me i was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not forget me at all i love that we grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas a personal favorite and the mushroom appetizer the mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite the patatas bravas really never fail they remind me of my moms version of french fries id highly recommend this place for a date it seems to pay off in more ways than one always great service and interesting eats still lovin tuck shop for being in my neighborhood
__label__1 tanked fish is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood and we frequent it often rolls are of a great quality and there are some rather unusual and pleasantly different ones there price is very reasonable and drinks selection if not overly excessive is cool place is not riddled with kids like many other places are and you can actually kick back and have a conversation there one one of the weekday evenings they have this special thing where you can request your musical choice from this rather large list its real neat what else is neat their happy hour on wednesday i am not sure what day exactly to be honest call them if you really want to know when drinks starters and most rolls are 12 this really makes a huge difference i gave this place 4 starts this is pretty much as high as it goes for me for this i like eugene
__label__1 my wife and i went here and sat on the patio near the canal the temperature was perfect for being outside and the view of camelback was sublime my only complaint about the seating was it was difficult to read our menus when we were there in the evening our waiter was friendly and helpful the chicken salad sandwich i had was very good and my wife loved the burger she ordered all in all a very nice and relaxing sunday evening dinner
__label__1 i tried narai when my family was in town everyone enjoyed their meal they have a wide variety of thai food and sushi and a full bar our servers were very attentive i had the tofu pad thai with medium spice which is still pretty spicy it had a nice flavor to it and enough of a portion to take leftovers home for lunch my sister really enjoyed her papaya salad and thai soup and my parents liked the cashew chicken the sauce had a great flavor there arent a ton of thai restaurants in north scottsdale id say this one is a very solid pick
__label__1 this place shouldnt even be reviewed because it is the kind of place i want to keep for myself
__label__1 delishhhh blueberry crepes wcream cheese
__label__1 this is one of best libraries i have ever been to i live very close by and it is very easy to stop by to pick something up or drop something off this is always a must visit before road trips to california to pick up books for the adults and kids as well as dvd s for the road trip we visit this location at least once a week and the kids love it
__label__1 yeah it was good my wife i went with 2 other foodie couples who are good friends for our monthly side dish function the food was all fantastic all 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis which they all said were very tasty as well but at 1216 per im a little put off im more of a beer guy anyway so i had a couple of craftbrews that are not available everywhere and then settled on a firestone dba a very very tasty beer and had several of those great food great booze club music atmosphere is pretty cool outdoor area is excellent felt like an idiot when i had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said he in huge letters on the bottom of the door oh and then 6 or 7 strong beers into the evening i found that the mirror next to the only urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal which i tried unsuccessfully to walk to why is that guy walking directly toward me oh its me in the mirror dumbass so then after relieving myself in the actual urinal i go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doenst exist and somebody else says yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too so i dont feel like such a dumbass anymore fun night
__label__1 when my mom suggested we eat at a simple casual mexican restaurant for her birthdaymy brothers grad school graduation celebration i was a little surprised she herself has only been in one other mexican restaurant years ago and loved itno wait i take that back shes been in one other one but did not enjoy it as much as the first time eh anyhoomy brother suggested arriba because it is one of his favorite restaurants note i keep encouraging him to yelp about his favorite places in phoenix since he lives there it was not terribly crowded for a saturday afternoon which was nice i was pleased to learn that they have brunch options which is served until 4 pm on the weekends if i recall up until the restaurant i had trouble deciding what i wanted to eat since i had gained some weight being around familyeh that happens right i opted for the make your own omelet and it came with beans and some potatoes the potatoes were bland and needed a little salt for flavor my dad who has never stepped in a mexican restaurant only because he is not a huge fan or an expert in mexican cuisine enjoyed his carne asada and rice his plate was clean he did say he would come back again and for my dad to say that is a good thing my mom and brother shared some a lot of food but honestly i was not paying attention to what they ordered oh and for dessert we had 3 orders of the flan i still stand by that my mom makes the best leche flan ever but the one at arriba was just as tasty i think the cinnamon sprinkles help overall i would have to say that we as a family enjoyed this place sadly our trip in phoenix was too short otherwise we would have gone back for at least a second round we were seated right away and had great service ps the little togo menus at the front are slightly different than the big menus at the table i only know because my dad wanted to order something else from the small menu and apparently it is only served during the week
__label__1 my wife and i just dined at this restaurant i am a chef and must say that chef chriss concept is one i have not experiencedthe food was outstanding service excellent and the decore was creativedown to the flower pot wine bucket and old wooden crate that it sat on our entrees were served on either a bed of sundried ploenta or baby spincach and blackrice what really intrigued me was the slaw made of shredded green papaya that was part of the appetizer course being a chef i had to share a neat appetizer that i recently found using a baby corn shoot chef keep up the suberb cafe monarch bravo
__label__1 excellent food i do say the service isnt always the best but the outcome of the food exceeds my expectations definitely recommend ordering the artichoke salad not what youd expect out of a typical boring salad not just stuffed with a large amount of dull boring lettuce but filled with spices and tons of flavor
__label__1 i was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate they put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome i wasnt in the mood for bbq at the time but so i ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli i love the healthy options thanks to red robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because its easy to blow itespecially with the desert menu
__label__1 i just moved to az from honolulu with my bf and found this to be a great breakfast brunch place they do close at 230pm on my last visit i ordered the amazing 2 for you you get the choice of a half sandwich either soup or salad for 795what a deal i ordered the monterey club the no 5 chinese salad what an amazingly refreshing lunch i highly recommend this day cafe this may not be the best review but if you stop by the line may sway you
__label__0 i received a buy one entree get one free coupon for joining their fan club membership so my son and i went this morning for breakfast got there around 9am greeted and seated immediately in a nice booth waitress was quite knowledgeable and took our order after giving us time to peruse the menu i ordered the country fried steak and eggs which comes with oj country potatoes and toast as did my sons breakfast which he ordered the standard bacon and eggs with an extra egg we both agreed that the breakfast was ok both our potato sides were cold i had a small thick dollop of gravy on my country fried steak which was quite good but had to ask for extra gravy put in a serving bowl it was so thick it wouldnt pour so i used a spoon i spread it on my country fried steak with a butter knife much like you would a piece of toast weird watch out for the coffee if you are offered flavored coffee it is extra hidden charges for everything in other words even with the coupon the total came to almost 2000 for 2 average breakfasts tip cancer donation etc i had to do a double take on the check to see if they included the coupon nothing really bad but nothing really good either i should have known better probably not coming back my son seconds the motion
__label__1 theres a lot to love about the mission the experience comes so close to 5star that it makes me want to nitpick about all the tiny things that fall juuuust short so they can fix them for my next visit the bar what a lovely refreshing basil margarita it was just sweet enough without being syrupy but bartender why is getting a recommendation out of you like pulling teeth the food excellent tableside guacamole it lived up to the very high expectations set by all the other reviewers my dinner partners hangar steak was very juicy for such a thin cut and the dressing from the tomatillo salad give the whole dish a tangy acidic bite my chorizo porchetta was very unique and flavorful but a little more sauce wouldve saved it from being slightly dry i love though how the star of the entrees really is the meat here the portions were generous and the sides were an accompaniment not a competitor almost forgot about the pumpkin bread pudding we shared he loved the scotchcarmel sauce which i thought was too sweet i loved the moist fragrant bread which he thought was missing pumpkiny spice to each their own the atmosphere its a gothic romance come to life with beautiful dark metal chandeliers warm glowing salt bricks and dim lighting i just wish the table of 6 old men talking golf wasnt sooo close a little more room between tables would complete the intimate decor the service i have no complaints here our server was excellent and never overwhelming the lady who made our guac was all charm and kudos to the chef who sent us complimentary street corn yummy by the way a note on the street corn i felt like this was a dish that wouldve won the top chef competition where they had to reinvent convenience store food the grilled slightly salty crunchy corn topped with creamy spicy cheese sauce beats any ampm nachos ive ever had lots of wonderful food still to try here i will be back very soon for brunch with mom
__label__1 some amazing friends of mine surprised me and set up a whole birthday dinner at jug n barrel this was my first time here and was shocked at how cute the place was even in a strip mall it actually had a fireplace which gave it a very cozy feel the wine list is great and not too intimidating we had a great server who even put together a wine flight to match my sweet tooth the only thing that knocks a star more like 15 stars off the rating is the completely average food we had a group of about 12 and ordered several appetizers and all of us ordered entrees i dont think any of us were blown away by our meals although i will not return for a meal i would return for wine with friends
__label__0 have tried this place a few times now we sometimes order it for everyone at work my impression is that its a step up from taco bell
__label__0 if it wasnt for the bad food i would go here more than once or twice a year the meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie i order a salad only because they do catering i have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers the service is ok they have a couple of generic draft beers everything is overpriced caveat emptor if you order an entree
__label__1 they had amazingly quick service during lunch the servers were very polite almost to the point of being obnoxious i ordered the daily specialbacon cheeseburgerwhich came out hot fresh and delicious though the fries were heavily oversalted our drinks were also quickly refilled without us asking which was nice but unfortunately their tea basically tasted like water overall it was a good experience and i would come back again
__label__1 ahhh whole foods john mackeys little baby he has turned into a behemoth within the industry i am so torn by whole foods of course most everything is more expensive this could stem from when mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better mackey is also a vegan but has said if he didnt sell animal products it would be bad for businessif the business even existed yeah i get it but i dont like it does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company ceo of the store they lovehate ok ill cut this short this whole foods is an older store not the real old school hippyesque store but its nothing like the newer flagship stores around the countrylike the one on mayo this obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller albeit more quaint store if i go to the mayo store i am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because i was lost in a trance browsing this makes my girlfriend very angry i dont buy all my groceries here because i dont think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at whole foods that you cant find anywhere elsetrader joes sprouts sunflower etc the veganvegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores they simply carry all the latest and greatest it may not be the cheapest but they carry it one last item and this is for pizza loving vegan fools whole foods was one of the first places to carry daiya cheese they actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section but they also have it available at the deli the usual counter worker isnt that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesnt make the pizza any less tasty you can get one of their surfboard pizzas which will feed 2 for 23 days with a couple of toppings with daiya cheese for 1599 this may be the best deal going at whole foods and make up for that 8 bar of dark chocolate you just bought
__label__0 oh man this is not the place i imagined i would assign my first 2star rating i woke up as sad and disappointed as i felt last night leaving the legendary old school durants after an evening of less than mediocre food and terrible service sigh honey had a great lunch there a few months back and was excited to impress me with dinner we saw durants listed on restaurant week and were excited for the excuse to squeeze into one of their comfy booths amidst the bowtie clad staff and velvet wallpaper the instant time travel type setting usually makes for an incredible dining experience shall i fault the poor rating to their efforts at succumbing to a prixfixe menu perhaps our time at the bar proved to be the best part of the night watching the bartender mix the martinis the way my pops used to was nostalgia at its best i loved that they serve bottles of beer with a toothpick of meat and cheese that is brilliant it could transform me into a beer drinker after all we met up with friends and continued on to the dinner portion of the evening moving on to the booth our waitress was definitely in the weeds having been in her shoes before i always try and accommodate the situation we ordered an appetizer and a few cocktails and waited to order dinner when she seemed able appetizer of artichoke dip was yummy tortillas and garlic bread and warm cheesy dip delivered promise the limited menu was just that okay first course saladsoup options main course offered pot roast a small steak or chicken fried steak stewed steak grilled steak or fried steak really your menu is impressiveif you really dont want to participate in restaurant week then dont honey ordered the chicken fried steak as a continuation of the old school vibe i ordered the trout off the regular menu after c pointed out the fish option j ordered the cfs too food took a bit but we had good conversation flowing so it wasnt a problem salads and soup were fine main course arrived and we were all a bit surprised by the size of the fried steak i guess when you think of this meal from the past it encompasses half the plate and is oozing with country gravy this steak was the size of a burger and had a dollop of thick gravyesque goo on the top garlic mashers were appropriately placed my trout was supposed to be topped with a lemon caper sauce but instead it was slathered with a gravy that hinted at lemon and was all wrong for a fish the trout was painfried and should there have been a light sauce it would have been good but the fried fish with the gravy was just so not good the fried steak too so not good mashers achieved an appropriate level of goodness but you really dont want mashed potatoes to lead your dinner we were devastated the whole experience was so not what we came for or expected i do want to give durants another chance and order a big juicy steak and let them wow me like they do to so many but it will be a while before our trek downtown includes a walk through their kitchen
__label__1 i came here by myself because non of my fellow conference peeps wanted to walk 10 minutes to dinner im glad i made that short walk to here because i enjoyed eating their prime rib it was cooked just right and it was rested correctly needless to say i was so stuffed that my 10 minute walk became a 15 walk back to the hotel
__label__1 totally a locals hangout this very unpretentious wine bar is a favorite the owner darlene has a great selection of wines from smaller labels for you to try if youre not sure what to get theyll help you find a bottle in your price range theyve got the cheap stuff all the way to the 80 range if you feel like spending some money you can buy a bottle at retail open it up at their bar and enjoy it with a nosh lots of smaller appetizers cheese and crackers etc or order by the glassflight from their bar checkout their website before you go or if you live in the area subscribe to their email newsletter there is something different going on every day live music tastings specials etc
__label__1 so i just called to book a class for me and a friend from a groupon we bought the classes for the next 2 weeks were all booked i called and spoke to a very pleasant paul who said they are extending this offer for a month yippee you rock and we cant wait to try our hand at this exciting craft huge props for great customer service
__label__1 in times of big corporations it was nice to find such a warm and friendly coffeehouse in the valley it is just a great place to hang out setup your laptop or read a book i thoroughly enjoyed my joltachinno a much better version of the starbucks frappacino which is just too sweet we came back another day for lunch and all i can say is yum i have never had food like this at a coffeehouse amazingly for our second time there they recongnized us wow i am glad that i have found my new hangout when i come to the valley
__label__1 i was pleasantly surprised when i walked in and saw that country market had a deli here i picked up a roast beef sandwich and some potato salad when i was eating it my friend said it sounded like i was having a mouth orgasm because i moaned after every bite if you live in the area and havent been here yet try the sandwiches theyre great
__label__1 finally a noncorporate place in chandler that doesnt try too hard yet knows how to please with highend ingredients local and organic when possible i ordered the chefs burger from their lunch menu grassfed ground inhouse 8 oz burger with arugula gruyère and onion rings i personally would have liked the arugula melted under the gruyère or tossed with the russian dressing it was too ordinary undressed on the top bun but it is the chefs burger and if thats how he likes it then thats the way it should be enjoyed oh and the onion rings are awesome the service was genuine and friendly the food came out reasonably fast and hot it would have been nice if you could hear the musicit was just too quite i will definitely come back and try other menu options and i highly recommend bld
__label__1 one of the perks to being an only child is me time there is something special about having time to yourself when the only obligation you have is to check in on yelp leave a quick tip and grab a lemonade from the mall because it is 109 degrees outside yesterday was that day i had stumbled across the art of shaving ive been in their stores in other cities before of course i havebecause if you look at any of my pictures you will realize a couple things 1 im vain 2 im hairless as soon as you step foot into this store you are in a true gentlemans club not the kind that will take all your dollar bills you wont make it rain here this is the ultimate shaving store soaps creams blades razors balms brushes and mugs you name it they have it the staff knows what they are talking about i explained to them that i have a very old safety razor and a brush both were passed down by my grandfather who passed away when i was a teenager they didnt pressure me into buying anything although i did end up leaving with some shaving cream they even gave me a proper demo on how to use it properly with my brush ive been used to shaving soaps and the usual aerosol creamsso the little tutorial was nice also there is a master barber in the back of the house that does straight razor shaves haircuts and mens facials remember earlier when i said that me time is a perk this is the best place to spend it if you are a dude if you are a woman buy your man or your manfriend a gift from here this place is simply amazing one last warning the store is pricey but worth every single penny
__label__0 they were absurdly busy i had a bars eye view of the care that goes into the 395 12 dozen oysters i would not order them myself dinner felt rushed i didnt feel like a very valued client and the poor gentleman next to me waited at least 2530min for his 12 dozen oysters carelessly drained of their delicious fluids my dinner was good but relied heavily on its fat content to carry its flavor my cocktails were good i would come back for those it took another 10min just to pay my tab after i had finished my dishes were cleaned up by a bartender who looked like he just run a marathon dripping with sweat not exactly how i like to finish my evening thanks but no thanks pappadeaux
__label__1 i grew up in arizona and we went to wongs every sunday after church three years ago we got stationed in hawaii everytime i come home our first stop is wongs i love everything about it wongs is my comfort food
__label__1 i am a gspot addict had to limit myself from going every week though took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend it was his first time to try gelato hes a coldstone guy 100 and he really enjoyed the tiramisu gelato the focaccia flatbread is awesome and i would post a photo of the focaccia flatbread i got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad but in the words of lolcat i eated it and forgot to take a photo first my favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette the mintchip gelato is freaking awesome the stracciatella gelato mixed with mint even better gspot is so awesome that i just walked back over and got my mint stracciatella combo baby c wanted something sweet d
__label__1 i am ready to update you to a five because the last three times i have been there your service has been better the huevos rancheros has been consistently perfect i have never had to wait for a seat at the bar and i want to hug the cute new bartender because she is quirkily cute if you were still serving breakfast at 6pm i would come eat you now
__label__1 decided to roll the dice on a saturday night and try this place everyones been raving about despite showing up at prime time to a packed house we got a table relatively quickly the food was delicious and came out promptly i didnt any problems with the wait staff like others have expressed the presentation was a little more than expected without feeling pretentious or like i had to keep my elbows off the table not that im a slob didnt get a chance to make it upstairs but the main dining and bar areas were welllit but still cozy and had a simple modern feel good place for a date or toss back a few cold ones with your crew st francis is definitely on my list now
__label__1 i had to try it i had to see what became of the space that was once the finest restaurant in phoenixscottsdale the design of j g made me think really as mary elaines the space was elegant regal sophisticated refined as j g the space feels like a sleek flashy vegas restaurant i am still recovering from that shock i was there to give it a try so here you go tasting menu tuna tartar delicious parmesan risotto needed salt but good sea bass excellent so moist beef good but excellent tasting steak sauce was ice cold chocolate cake wow cocktail wine sidecar awesome some sort of big red wine our waiter was good and explained the menu very well there were some errors is service so i had to keep reminding myself this is not mary elaines its a steakhouse
__label__0 a friend was visiting from out of town and we decided we wanted a pampering experience so rather than go to my neighborhood manipedi place we went over to old town scottsdale for lunch and a we hoped luxurious pedicure this place looked very promising and the lady at the front really talked them up so we took the plunge everything seemed promising we waited in a lovely outdoor area until they were ready for us then disappointment the pedicure was nothing i couldnt get for half the price the massage chairs just vibrated my feet were still a little rough afterward and the paint job wasnt even that good basically this was very overpriced for what was an incredibly unexceptional pedicure we still enjoyed ourselves but agreed we would never go back there
__label__1 its 400 am on a friday youve just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much youre starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol enter jerrys the place was open the place was clean the food was good the service was great the prices were great way better than a dennys better than most diners ive been to actually i had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious the ham steak was gigantic the eggs perfect and hash browns were done just right crispy and good
__label__1 great hotel though its more of a condo got a room for my mom this past weekend and she liked it so much she didnt want to leave the resort our room was very large had s dining room living room fully stocked kitchen 2 patios and a large bedroom and bathroom theres like 3 or 4 pools in the resort a nice restaurant and bar with live music its close to desert ridge and the quarter so good location for out of own visitors got an amazing price through hotwire service was also outstanding nice job xona
__label__1 the venue which is close to campus usually gets all the big shows from hot hot heat to incubus to mickey avalon to brand new the great thing about the venue is that you can stand almost anywhere and still be able to see the band theres a big bar inside with friendly bartenders although the well drinks can be a little pricey theres usually a hot dog vendor outside and most of the bands performing can be found walking around before andor after their sets making it easy to mingle the downside about the marquee is that parking sucks theres not a ton of parking in the clubs lot and the nearby lots usually fill up fast so be prepared to trek down mill to get to and from your car if you dont arrive early
__label__1 yogurtbuilderz provides a good sized dining area with many choices of yogurt and toppings i did find it a little difficult to locate when i attempted to find the building it is tucked away in the back corner of a strip mall parking lot it was dark late at night and took a few passes around the parking lot to zero in on the location the staff was very friendly and the place was busy even for a sunday night for the staff and selection i give it a 3 star rating it was good but i didnt find it any different than the growing list of competition i know this place is popular and selfserve frozen yogurt establishments are all the rage now the economic model is great you pay by the ounce and have your choice of any variety of yogurt and any topping available customers have the opportunity to build it as they wish which allows those with specific tastes to have their wants fulfilled more so than a traditional store offering the generic selection of choices all of that in mind i dont like it the industry too many choices creates an opportunity for indecision and slows down the lines as people stand around wondering what to put in it next for those new to the game you can create something that turns out to be rather nasty for example the white chocolate sauce is really very sweet and i find if mixed with other toppings makes it almost unbearable the other reason i do not like these places is that i do not like to pay for food that i then have to make and serve myself i go to restaurants and pay for a meal rather than cook it at home because a i dont like doing it and b i am horrific at it while frozen yogurt does not require much preparation there is still some assembly required if i am paying i prefer to have it built for me but i realize i am in the minority as popular as these chains are becoming i wouldnt be surprised to see froyo overtake unfriend as word of the year in 2010
__label__1 im sad to say that i wasnt in love with macalpines the fact that the building has never been restored is cool in a dirty kind of way the floors will never be clean enough because they are so old that may seem ridiculous but cleanliness is important to me when im eating somewhere our server was odd but helpful and attentive we spent a good amount of time oogling the random items displayed throughout and were entertained with our surroundings the food is where i saw the problem my mac cheeseburger was bland and tasteless my broccoli and cheese soup was below average i wasnt impressed one bit we ended up having dessert i opted for a single scoop of chocolate malt krunch which id never had before and didnt love total personal preference as my friend loved it macalpines is cool but i think purely as a place to get something sweet
__label__1 i was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on saturday night yep i was odd man out again and in more ways than one as i will note in a bit we got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus most of the folks there had been there several times before everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so i ordered fettuccine alfredo 1895 with salad and garlic knots i know its un american not to be a fan of pizza and wings their antipasta arrived and i sipped on my beer then the pizzas came then the wings followed by my pasta somehow my order got separated from the rest and i had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last the side salad wasnt earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread the pasta was delicious i mentioned i was not a fan of pizza or wings but i was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of giovanni wings both were really good the pizza was a thin crisp in spots crust the wings had none of the heat i normally associate with wings i had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me after dinner there was warm zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice creambrowniewhipped cream thing which her husband and i finished most of if you followed along you will note i ate a lot of different stuff and i paid for it for several hours afterward for a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late i just had the one beer 25oz but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception weak all were done well this is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more tvs than i have seen outside of vegas the original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts there is a good sized outdoor area too
__label__1 friendly and knowledgeable staff they even have a nutritionist on site which shows their dedication to promote healthy living i think its great that they make the food daily and have appropriate portion sizes i gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 because they didnt have as many vegetarianvegan meals as i would have liked what i did purchase though tasted delicious i look forward to going back and checking out their meals again
__label__1 this is my favorite chipotle to go to because its the closest one to my work i call in orders all the time and the staff always has it ready to go even when i dont have a pick up order they always move quickly to get everyone through the line which is great because when im hungry i want everyone out of my way
__label__1 ye olde pipe has a great selection of cigars and a very big walkin humidor almost too big i say that because as i walked around i came across a few boxes of cigars that were way too dry with that said i still found several cigars that were fresh and moist what i liked best about ye olde was the variety they had several cigars at all price points so if you cant afford to smoke an opus x they had plenty of cigars for less than 10 if you arent an avid smoker i dont know if you will get any help because the staff did not seem very friendly or welcoming but if you know what you want there is a good chance they have it
__label__1 well my first review of over easy have gone here a few times only reason i dont go more often probably because of the wait the food is definately makes me want to return the hopple popple the wolf pack and what i had today the loco moko only criticism is the rice great lemonade when i used to drink lemonade and the hash browns they have tater tots ill be back when i can get up early
__label__0 i started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch it was ok i got a lunch combo meal but i didnt pay the service was really great but the food was not just kind of plain its convenient to work so i will probably be back i just wont have very high expectations
__label__1 john did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my infiniti after grelichs failed to fix my car properly john is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable he has a customer for life from me
__label__0 i had never been to rainforest cafe and im glad that i got to try it because i love trying things at least once however this will also be my last time going there well start from the beginning the atmosphere was nice for the jungle but it was so loud that i could not hear my wife talking to me i felt that i had to scream at her to talk our waitress was nice but didnt check on us often we barely understood her either because she speak loud enough we got our drinks ten mins later and my iced tea was good but my wifes chocolate shake was gross too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive we sent it back so she could get water another 10 mins later food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and 12 jeez so expensive for something so plain i got onion rings for an extra few dollars they were okay but worth the extra few my wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they didnt give her more than ten i like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced not worth it at all the food was mediocre but left me sick that night not as amazing as i thought it would be after seeing it many times in vegas
__label__1 very runofthemill solid nothingexcitingorsurprising type of place its the kind of restaurant thats not your first choice but when all your other options are closed or too far or too crowded you come to village tavern and you end up not being disappointed i was there today and had the 3 mimosas with the crabcakes benedict the potatoes that accompany the eggs are way too mealy but the eggs themselves and the sauce are spoton wished the crabcake had a bit more flavor bread service is by request only which i really like our hostess and our server were polite and efficient overall a good place to bring mom and dad to on a lazy sunday afternoon
__label__1 i have been going to postino since it opened i remember the matt diamond era susan era and now the brent karlicheck era i really like the evolution as to what it has become now granted i am personal friends with brent and matt so i want to disclose this upfront but i am elated with the new direction of the wine program as i think it is superior to most in its consumer friendly format grab a plate of bruschetta and 5 glass of abc anything but cabernet at the bar ask brent or the chilled staff to help you pick something great like the mythical arcas you can bear the budget bacchanalian orgy right in the heart of arcadia
__label__0 i feel sad to write thisbut vincent needs to improve things or his place will be only a past memory im ok with that based on the dinner i had there recently the restaurant was packedbut with people who had grouponsi only wish i had because my dinner would not have been 17700 too much for a weak and sad plate of out of date food we had the foi gras small portion and sosoduck chimichangas they were decent the wild boar was a tiny servingwe were fine with that because it was tough and difficult to chew it was accompanied with a hospital style vegetable medly of green beans with carrot shreds and minute white rice we also had troutit was covered in a heavy white sauce french and had the same veg medly and white riceseriously like the hospital foodor a big banquet service it was ediblebut not greatwe each had a glass of wine no dessert for usit was hot in there and the arches and decor reminded me of a taco bell i wouldnt even go back if it was a free meal
__label__1 3 stars on any given day my server pat made this a fun experience and was the extra 2 stars pat is one of the few people in this world who really enjoys being good at what he does i asked him how long and with much joy he replied i can get your food in 1015 minutes sure enough it took 9 minutes i value time and in my business my word is everything pat understands this and when i eat here again i will insist on his table i recommend you do the same ask for pat top notch pat dont ever change
__label__1 they must have renovated this place in the last year it is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded hover over a table to get a seat necessity it now reminds me much more of the dreaded panera bread chain in california but the food is still much better and has much less of a mass produced feeling and taste the service management staff etc were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared i love carbscarbs with carbs and a side of carbs they serve warm syrup with their pancakes yum and their bread is just amazing the side of pancakes is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent fluffy and tasty they offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness cinnamon nutmeg cocoa to top it off just right today before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshinewell the other land of that anyway we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate i would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends
__label__1 it was a rainy saturday yes thats right it was raining and hot and muggy ugh but when it rains i just want to go sit in a coffee shop and people watch or just relax a little and i dont have a coffee pot at home right now yes i know its somewhat sacriligious for someone such as myself who is a caffine addict sad but true i just needed my fix and its that time of year peoplethe pumpkin spice latte is back hooray it is my all time favorite this is the closest starbucks to where i live just a few blocks away when my friend took me here the first time she told me it was the gay starbucks yup i think that is safe to say im straight but if i were gay dang id probably be here more often i like this location though it never seems to be super busy and there is always a place to sit weather its inside or out its clean and the staff are friendly it also helped that i was cleaning out my wallet and found a starbucks gift card score there is not much else located near this starbucks the good egg which looks like somewhere i might try and jamba juice but sadly it looks like just about everything else has closed up in this little strip mall too bad because it must have been a hoppin place a few years back i may have to go back soonlike today maybeim getting another craving for my fave psl yum and now they have a psl frap i have not tried it yet but i will sounds like pumpkin pie through a straw yumo
__label__1 ive been here a couple of times the first time was on first fridays i expected it to be packed but i was able to walk right in and be seated they had a table reserved and they must not have shown so we lucked out i got the sante fe a roast beef panini and it was great they had some good beers on tap too its a cool little funky place to grab a good sandwhich the second time i came here it was after a concert there was some horrible band playing that i wish would have shut up so i could hear the people in front of me without having to feel sharp pains in my ear but the meal was still good and i liked it any place that is open late close to downtown is perfect especially since the kitchen doesnt close until 1230
__label__1 was there last night and had a good time i learned several things 1 charlies has a cover charge of 3 if you get there after a certain time i believe this starts at midnight or 1 am i got there after 1 am and the place was packed absolutely packed 2 yes in phoenix some bars can stay open until 4 am gasp yes i know it blew me away as well 3 the little mexican food place attached to charlies serves really good food late night but now i understand why they cant sell water or soda through the inside window to charlies customers thats because charlies wants to charge patrons 250 for a bottle of water than the mexican restaurant sells for 1 outside other than that i had a good time
__label__1 christy is an amazing cake artist she has an impressive portfolio as she has a flair for creativity her cakes are amazing and are truly oneofakind she also has several delicious cake flavors to choose from or she can create one for you she has made several cakes for our family and i have been impressed with everyone of them i was also excited to see her compete on tlcs ultimate cake off show early this spring if youre looking for a sculpted cake or one that will be the center of attention at your next party then i recommend you call phoenix cake company
__label__1 i am just providing a review for the mother and infant care department only since my wife has just had our second baby delivered here we really enjoy our stay at this hospital the facility is very clean and nice room are good size with shower box inside bathroom so you can take shower during your stay and care for the mom during the stay mom and the caregiver are entitle to have breakfast lunch and dinner for free all you have to do is call and place your orders the foods are quite quality and the portions are decent i am really impressed with this the nurses are all knowledgeable caring and nice they are always there when you call them and need them since this is our second child it works out perfectly that the nurses only come by when we call them or when they do their routine checks so the rest of the time you are left alone to rest the hospital where my first child was born was different they let lots of interns and students come to our rooms all the times for training so we were constantly bothered however in my opinion if it is your first child you may find that having people around all the time could help you not to worry too much since we all know nothing when the first child come the reason i didnt give this hospital 5 star is just because our discharge was taking so long we thought we would be out by 11 am but we didnt get out until 3 pm they said that because it was on sunday i think it make sense overall i do recommend this hospital for any new mother
__label__0 i usually do not write reviews but was so horrified by my experience i had to went for a late night bite and drink with a friend they were fairly busy so we had a seat at the bar as i frequent the moon often i was happy to see the bar was busy as well the bartender quickly came over and was noticably intoxicated as she could not even tell me the flavors of vodka they had we ordered our drinks and watched as she broke glass into the ice knocked over glassware and broke a beer bottle as we looked around most of the guests had the same look of horror on their face we decided to order some food as she spilled my drink on us refilled it with something completely different and she could barely even talk at this point we saw management watch her behavior and do nothing as she preceded to grab dirty glassware and refill it with beer i was so appauled by this we left befpre finishing our drinks or food im not sure what she was on but if its visible to paying customers it should be visible to management being beyond embarassed for the establishment i would doubt i will come back sad as we would frequent the moon 23 times a week horrible
__label__1 ts glass did a wonderful job replacing my car window they came right to the house within 2 hours of my call had the window replaced within 30 minutes and treated me like a queen frank installed the glass and couldnt have been nicer thank you t s glass
__label__1 hidden house has some things you expect in a neighborhood bar lots of pool tables giant circular bar tagged restroom friendly locals somehow curious or maybe protective cheap cocktails and specials on pitchers of beer then theres a few things different about this place an usual mix of suits and sweat pant old and young some talented pool players and a really smooth bartender located in the new downtown and within walking distance from my hotel the walk there and back was actually as much fun as sitting in the lounge some parts of downtown are stunning especially at night when the lights are on and nobodys home
__label__1 freaking huge portions the sandwiches are super yummy the french toast covered in bananas and that crumbly sugary delicouisness is to die forand you might unless you jog 10 miles afterwards but the real treat is the desert counteroh my god even to just look at it is an honor good bang for the buck
__label__0 the latest consumer report magazine gave this restuarant a higher point value that houstons we disagree they tried to be but couldnt even come close we were very disappointed in the lack of service timing of food and food hostesses were seen drinking from gatorade bottles from there hostess stand sara our server spent more time chatting with her tables that serving and taking care of her guest the manager on duty was checking his telephone and did not check our table my chicken was very dry salad and soup were good will not return
__label__1 we had a fun early dinner on the patio here at boombozz the advertised happy hour specials appeared to be a very good value my fave was the soft pretzels cheese i also had the wedge salad and it was excellent they dont skimp on the blue cheese my son had the pepperoni pizza and even his discriminating palate was very happy a crisp blonde draft for me and ice cream for him polished us off and we left full happy
__label__1 i actually visited here about 5 months ago but i liked it so much i figured i should give it a few good words i was at the mall looking for something healthier than a pizza or burger and decided upon this place it is part of their little slogan after all i was not disappointed i chose the beef kabob with a side of fries and pita bread with a cup of hummus everything was positively fresh and absolutely delicious and the portions were big too i didnt think i would be filled up after the meal but i was stuffed the staff was very friendly and cooked everything in a timely manner i was surprised they werent getting nearly as much business as the other joints around the food court they dont know what theyre missing
__label__1 ive been to almost all of the dog parks in the east valley and this is definitely one of the best i drive 5 miles each way daily to go there it is by far the largest in tempe which is easy because the others are tiny it is large enough to accommodate a lot of dogs and people which there are at peak times has lots of grass 2 doggy water fountains so they dont have to drink out of community bowls trees around the perimeter and a ramada with tablesbenches and other benches located around the perimeter it is open early in the morning and late at night there are lights on until 10 pm there are also city supplied poop bags in dispensers which are usually stocked although occasionally not so bringing a bag doesnt hurt the people are pretty friendly and the poop situation people that dont clean it up isnt that bad in comparison with many other parks especially cosmo and chaparral there is only one large section no small or inactive section but it seems to work out ok as the dogs arent overly rowdy or aggressive in general ive never seen a real fight there is a sort of walking path around the entire perimeter and many do walk it for exercise overall a well above average place to take your dog location its a little hard to find take kyrene to carver halfway between warner and elliot west on carver about 2 blocks on the left there are other routes but this is the easiest unless youre coming from west of the park anyone is welcome to contact me for my opinions on the other dog parks in the east valley
__label__0 i wouldve gone 2 stars if i were more forgiving i could reason that it was the end of the day that a big crowd of wayward children had just come through or that a hurricane had blown out the back of the restaurant but then i tasted it it looks as if yogurtini is pretty wellloved around these parts and im sorry to report otherwise its was like a bomb had gone off the tables were filthy the machine handles were all gunked up there was assorted debris on the floor the two teenagers working were too busy gossiping about who knows what to do their jobs when we walked in there were a few customers sampling flavors among the ruins with no employees in sight we grabbed some sample cups from the register and dodged napkins and froyo puddles and other customers to try some different flavors the levers are the type that if you pull just a bit too far you make a mess all over your hand especially when trying to squirt a tiny bit in a sample cup this mess is then added to the greater mess of everyone else attempting this same operation and noone attempting to clean it up the stuff was real overpowering to where instead of tasting like what it was supposed to taste like it was bordering on medicine or like a bad imitation of what it was supposed to be like cheesecake doesnt taste like that good cheesecake anyway and neither does cake batter or banana where did the yogurt part go and how do you screw up cookies and cream exactly the two that were the best and most edible were the irish mint and the red velvet and thats what we mostly ended up with the decor didnt add to our experience everything is a mint green but it doesnt come off as retro or even minty but more like dated and hospitallike some people really like it but i found it unappetizing a surly teenager magically appeared as we approached the register only to disappear again soon after we paid we sat down at a dirty table and dealt with our choices while the two teens again made an appearance halfmoppinghalfattemptingtoclean while chattering back and forth about their dating woes we finished our yogurt but both strongly considered abandoning the whole affair i very well could have walked into yogurtini at the worst possible time on the worst possible day with all the factors stacked against them but i wont be returning to find out if this was the case
__label__1 the price is right 16 bucks for two huge lunches chips salsa and two drinks if youre looking for upscale squeaky clean and scottsdalish this aint your place if youre looking for good mexican food at reasonable prices quick service and great flavor head on over to carolinas
__label__0 was dragged back here for the first time in a few years it still sucks on a friday night its like 51 dude to girl ratio mill cue club is probably fine during the day if you actually want to shoot pool but if you want to see americas future losers stop in here after sundown
__label__1 some highlights loved the special of the day red velvet pancakes breakfast with cream cheese topping yum yum yum corned beef hash is canned and not homemade sad face fried chicken breakfast is a huge portion tasted really well but definitely sad that they only have sausage gravy would love it if they could offer a non pork gravy for the non oink eaters overall it was delicious simple menu great service thanks to waitress kelly she was really nice and would much rather support local eateries than ihop or dennys anyday
__label__1 we stopped in for a snack between lunch and dinner and luckily caught some great hh specials the restaurant was virtually empty on a friday around 3pm but i didnt mind much as we were in a hurry we sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed the company of the chef the service was a little bit rock to start off as i think 3 different people tried to take our order but once it got rolling we were good to go i had some sea bass nigiri 3 for 2 pieces spicy tuna roll 34 edamame 150 and a wonderful house salad topped with sliced pears and a delicious house dressing 3 the fish was all very fresh and clean tasting but the salad was honestly my favorite
__label__0 this review is based strictly on their burgers why i had just downloaded the yelp mobile app and harlows was among the top burger search results for tempe i know its a great breakfastsandwichdiner type place but had never thought of it as a burger destination until the yelp mobile results so i headed on over heres what i found its not a burger destination they offer 5 or so starting with a basic burger then different variations based on toppings green chile texas chile bacon focused etc i kept with the basic plus cheese for 8 you get the basic burger with fries and the variations bump it another dollar or two drinks are extra the menu said theirs were char grilled but i think they are steam table cooked no char or smokey taste on mine likewise i appreciate the regular menu featuring a lot of local product sources but id guess these are from a frozen patty national vendor it wasnt bad but it reminded me of many tailgates where we bought the big pack of frozen patties and simply reheated and cooked them on a grill the service was good and fast the fries were decent though nothing unique also from a frozen bag the bun was ok and it came with pickle onion and lettuce but its still unclear if they made them there or used an external source for the patty bottom line after tip i paid 12 for a burger fires and coke there was no wow moment if they produced something unique it might be worth it as it stands id definitely recommend the place for other things but not burgers its not their forte
__label__1 the food at beaver choice scandinavian bistro is delicious a little unusual but easily understood hearty and reasonably priced you can find out all about it at azcentralcom in an article by howard seftel then after reading this survival guide you should go and try it things you will need 1 an afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal this could take a long long time 2 a pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order along with an alternate choice 3 dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate 4 a snack to tide you over until your food arrives 5 a sense of humor but try not to laugh out loud heres our experience four of us entered the small 20 seat restaurant at 1210 there were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables a large and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table we were given menus and told to order at the counter there were many many choices of entrees a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare we avoided those and each one came with a choice of four side dishes you can see why a paper and pen might come in handy ken went to place our order but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him it took a while then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax i came up with another selection and ken went back to the counter where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering another wait then my second choice wasnt available either the sauce had to be reduced and wouldnt be ready until tuesday i figured id be safe with a third choice of swedish meatballs so i yelled over to ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper odd we settled in to wait for our food our drinks were brought to the table senas eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee the waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available but she could bring out some heavy cream i noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly one dish to one table a while later one dish to a different table companions were left twiddling their thumbs it so reminded me of hells kitchen i could hear gordon ramsey going ballistic shut it down you at about 1 pm my swedish meatballs were delivered i put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in luckily the servings are large we finished that off and waited another ten minutes before senas chicken schnitzel arrived that too was shared at about 135 kens entree was brought that left leon who had ordered tilapia we flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 pm engagement and would like our remaining dish she said shed look into it went into the kitchen and was not seen again a while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order that they had only a six burner stove and that 2 employees had called in sick i mentioned that i didnt think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others this is the way we do it were not going to change it and howard seftel thought it was all right was the emphatic reply more waiting at 150 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes to our disconcerted rumblings he said and youre not going to believe this the fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites at this point ill confess i started to laugh loudly and somewhat hysterically it may have been rude but i couldnt help myself we were out of time so leon decided hed take the fish to go ken went up to the counter and gave one of my valley vittles cards to the parasite staff member saying that the food was great but the service terrible at which point the staff member had a meltdown yelled at ken to get out of his restaurant then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out this was truly one of the oddest dining experiences ive ever had very alice in wonderland but if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above youll have some excellent food
__label__1 every sports town should have a bar like this just outside the arena its the first stop for conventioneers wandering into town for a drink post show this aint the place if youre looking for a quiet spot however if youre looking for a lively and well furnished sportsbar with attractive waitstaff this place is great the back room has huge leather booths the outdoor seating is nice tooit can get a little wild after the events let loose
__label__0 simply stateda greasy burger from start to finish not 4 methis place i will avoid while i continue on to a real good burger joint
__label__0 the service here was awful we waited patiently for over 15 minutes for our server to come by our table finally a hostess came by and noticed nobody was helping us and got us drinks another 15 minutes roll by and finally our server decides to make an appearance saying have you guys decided yet on what you want uhh yeah overall service was poor and food was just okay wont be going back
__label__1 i frequent this location before work quite a bit since i start work right around the normal dinner time always clean friendly and good food they have real silverware and real plastic plates lol
__label__1 great service great food and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable local breeze made it tolerable and i dont think my overlysweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience they had fans a swamp cooler and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing ok selection of beers certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite kiltlifter to go with my cocacola ham sandwich my girlfirned rachel o went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it the coca cola ham was huge and both of us only managed to eat half of it leftovers are always good service was spot on and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before get over it its no longer pallete move on and enjoy the local breeze
__label__1 very good place for breakfast lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th camelback i kinda found this place on accident i meant to just run into ajs and grab a salad to go but was forced to park basically across the driveway from taylors and being closer i opted to go there instead taylors is open 64ish i couldnt really tell they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door and they serve breakfast all day well all day theyre actually open which is always good with me i was in the mood for corned beef and bingo there it was nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese no saurkraut or thousand island please and the bread oh the bread grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside how in the hell do they do it i dont know but im in love
__label__0 nice looking place with average food and horrible service everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing we literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us he wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there the food was lukewarm and nothing special i was only here once so i hate to be so down on the place but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical dont waste your money
__label__1 the food was amazing and beautifully presented the atmosphere was clean quiet serene
__label__1 this particular walmart has gone a major renovation it is really clean store and well kept unlike most walmarts they have put a subway inside instead of a mcdonalds this is now super walmart so it has even groceries the interior of this store looks much like a target but has the walmart prices you can practically find everything here except alcohol it is right next to the 101 freeway off chaparral exit so its easy to find most walmarts are notorious for long waits but there is selfcheckout as well which speeds up the process
__label__1 food and atmosphere its excellent for me we ordered the chicken satay with peanut sauce my husband is generally picky and only praises the american comfort foods but this time he liked it a lot we ordered red chicken curry and two thumbs up i cant wait to dine in at that place again winner
__label__1 in town for a conference and craving real fooda substantial breakfast to start the day breakfast club walking distance to our hotel completely delivered our server was super friendly though we were sleepy and indecisive she recommended the french toast side we ordered to be made ala bananas foster yum more like dessert but nothing wrong with dessert for breakfast otherwise we had fairly standard egg dishes but they were yummy fresh served quickly and exactly what we needed the only complaint i have is wayfinding perhaps since they were setting up for an event downstairs it was moved but there were zero signs on ground level and while we could smell baconcoffeebreakfast we had to lap the block a few times and only found it because we figured we may as well try the escalator a few signs would go far
__label__1 i love books and i love bargains put the two together and you have a place called bookmans or as i like to call it my book heaven i recently purchased four books for about 30 thats the price of one new hardbound book and was thrilled by all the great bargains i found during my casual stroll through the many many isles of books cds and dvds what i love about the whole used bookstore concept is being able to give a new life to a book someone didnt want anymore i especially get a kick out of finding old books with inscriptions inside one i found says pam this is my number 1 all time favorite book i hope you have a relaxing holiday with your family and look forward to adventures in the new year i felt bad for the inscriber since the book obviously did not become pams favorite so i bought it in hopes that the inscription would ring true for me im glad a bookstore like bookmans is around and that they are able to compete with the big chains it is a great place to find great deals and im hooked
__label__1 one of my favorite places to take my 3 and 4 year old only drawback is it gets really crowded especially with the school groups so we call early to see how many school groups there are and then we decide if its worth it or not they sometimes host 500 kids at this museum and thats just not fun other than that this place is amazing
__label__1 beautiful hotel great pool nice restaurants fantastic service fabulous place to stay
__label__1 loved my haircut walked in and waited for just a minute the stylist cut exactly like i wanted and i walked out paying 20 which included the tip
__label__1 this club has great bands i saw 68 guns and metal elvis here also at the metal elvis show was a van halen tribute band called vh too the music is top notch and it is usually not too crowded so you can go right up to the stage however there are only a few tables which is annoying if you need a place to put your drink or coat or something i also wish the ceilings were a bit higher would be better if they could combine an indooroutdoor area with the stage overall the building seems cramped small and old the prices are reasonable though the location is kind of strange however we took a cab there but when we wanted to leave we couldnt get one to come pick us up despite the staff saying they called one finally we walked to a gas station and called from there this reminds me too much of club red great bands crappy club i hope that someone opens a brand new club for bands of this caliber or else i will need to open one myself
__label__1 we went on a saturday night and the place was completely dead there was only one other couple in the entire restaurant section very nice decor but the food was mediocre at best the only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the service was outstanding
__label__1 cheap and delicious cant beat that
__label__0 the burger i had there was tasteless and had a weird texture the fries were decent and their signature rootbeer was delicious but ive definitely had better elsewhere in all fairness i did not try their frozen selection so i will definitely come back to give them another try
__label__1 i was super excited to find a place in arizona that has vegetarian pho the service was just mediocre it met basic requirements without any friendliness very cost effective cheap
__label__0 i guess its not really the most accessible place but frank alberts is located in the arizona biltmore resort spa and serves as one of their restaurants to their guests since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods i decided to come here to have a proper breakfast when i asked what they recommended they immediately said the biltmore benedict i was easily sold so i ordered one and a coffee cool thing about the coffee is they just bring you a carafe to serve yourself coffee as you please not sure if this was because the waitress was lazy but i thought it was nice the eggs benedict themselves were not the best on one hand the ham that they used was overcooked ie jerky on the other hand the english muffin was over toasted and too crispy which kinda ruined the overall consistency it is a nice patio that they have to sit on so i will give them that they apparently have a bird problem where birds kinda come and scavenge for food i didnt really mind it
__label__1 had a fantastic massage with liz she knew all the muscle structure and pressure points though not the fanciest of places its perfect if you just need to get a massage if you want to be pampered and get the spa feel this may not be your place for me my back hurt from sleeping crooked and i left feeling much better
__label__1 my brother from san francisco was in town and missing the sushi from the bay area i decided id let him choose where wed go out even though id never ever heard of this place before it was definitely in a notsoglamorous area tucked on the side of a dinky shopping center sorry shopping center when we walked in i was pleasantly surprised by the quaint atmosphere and setup its definitely small but everyone working there and eating there seemed to be genuinely having a great time we sat at the barlong table in front of the sushi chefs which was a fun experience we started off with sake and it was pretty darn smooth we ordered a variety of different dishes including sea urchin eggs yellowtail shashimi and the king crab roll they were even accomodating to make my brother dishes that werent on the menu the chefs are so nice and fun and the prices are pretty good my brother was extremely impressed coming from a top sushi city i look forward to coming back and trying more of their extensive menu especially for happy hour
__label__0 sadly im giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star the mangeroperator guy sure the food here isnt all that bad probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch most of the crew members are pretty attentive dont seem to be meth addicted and i see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis looks like the crew changes over quite often and i know why my beef is not with the crew members oh no not with the food or cleanliness of the store nope the manager guy the guy who looks like a real pussy version of john leguizamo this guy ruins about every trip i have to this joint that is my problem with this joint elaboration will proceed now this guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes i have ever encountered in the fast food industry actually one of the biggest assholes period what a douche bag seems like any time i have a coupon this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it seriously what is it 30 cents i had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used i asked why and he said it was not legit why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead i checked the menu they would have lost 10 cents lady taking my order after pjl pussy john leguizamo walked away pretty embarassed said sorry not her fault never saw her working there after then was probably tired of that guys shit i dont blame you last trip here they have promos on their drink cups for free shit awesome we all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but i am a sucker for something free on my trip before the last i got one for a free corndog score i cash it in on my last trip and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket no sweat i could give a shit less as long as i get my corndog go to get my order ask where the corndog is pjl butts in the middle of the order says this is your order this is what you have and was a fucking prick about it me the customer yanks the receipt out of my hand gives me an attitude about it who the fuck talks to a customer like that even at a low rent fast food joint fuck you seriously the guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him puts his hand in front of the guys face and says ssssshhhhhh and snaps his fingers the same way i do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall who degrades their employees like that all he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket instead of listening he made a complete asshat out of himself it was a corndog what does that cost you anyway about 12 cents in batter a stick and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat dude cashier guy tattoo on your arm tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job no one deserves that shit i am actually ashamed i didnt say something for you i truly am what would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is my rant speaks for itself one shithead ruins it for the ones working for him for the ones working there i will pray for you you need it pjl get out of there and become a pimp in tijuana they need midget controlling assholes over there you would do great at that
__label__1 i have been taking vehicles to this place for 15 years mostly for routine maintenance but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you we have never had any problems with their service or repairs and they have always been reasonably priced fair and honest with us they also refill propane tanks note this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers previous names include mcclintock unocal and mcclintock 76
__label__1 was here awhile back and sharon hs review will sum it for atmosphere but i will try and cover my feelings on the taste the bruchetta is great yeah really that simple i havent tried much but bruchetta here but havent really been disappointed either even the ones that havent been a fan of of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select i still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good did try a pizza once and wasnt amazed but nothing stood out its been awhile since that the bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word oh and the service is very friendly and attentive one night i was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food barely a delay in my book and if i hadnt been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldnt have know it was longer than normal we got a nice little discount
__label__1 place is always friend and i love the pizza its by far my favorite pizza place sign up on their vip newsletter or eclub and you get a free pizza on your birthday get it for free and try it sounds good to me
__label__1 holy amazing i went here this past saturday for a baby shower in one of the private dining rooms and was absolutely blown away by the food we had a spread which included mac cheese sliders chopped salad some bread and french fries im still thinking about those sliders and the french fries i cant wait to go back and order from the full menu as is par for the sam fox course the decor is over the top i need to find out who designs these places and have them make over my house
__label__1 while calabria italian kitchen deli is at this location the grocery portion has been closed
__label__0 this location is a glorified garage sale it smells and nobody speaks english children are running free pulling clothes off racks and smashing into people if you are lucky you can find shoes but i have never found jack shit for clothes go upstairs to marshalls and spare yourself
__label__1 my husband and i love el metate we joke about putting a line item in our budget for this place we eat there so much their food is delicious they are family owned and operated always friendly their hot sauce is to die for both green and red its possible i like el metate better than amados
__label__1 we recently had a pleasure trip to az and i booked at the fairmont princess and i must say i made an awesome choice room was i guess a standard king but it was so large and spacious with a couch and seating area as well as a very comfortably appointed bath and patio the decor looked fresh and new as well very contemporary lovely we were in building c and overlooked the rosearoma garden which was quite quiet and pretty might have been a little better to overlook the lagoon with the firey fountain but we were pleased none the less pools were the best we swam in the main south pool the east pool and used the slides the kids area as well did a lot of night swimming as it was hot and gotta tell younight swimming rules we rarely get to do where i live restaurants and bars were very goodif a bit priceyas well we had dinner at bourdon steak by michael mina which was very tasty and nice ambiance ate at hacienda restaurant and also at the bar at an outside table kinda liked eating at the bar better yum of the drinks great tripgreat placewe will be back
__label__1 after a night of debauchery with friends my friend and i found ourselves craving a comforting bowl of pho ive been a regular at cyclos for quite sometime but decided to branch out and try something new i was pleasantly surprised with pho ao sen i am always happy when i enter an asian restaurant and see asians patronsprobably sounds a little weird but to me it speaks volumes the tranquil aesthetics of this quaint cafe made us feel welcomed and relaxed the decor had a modern asian feel minimalistic organic zen with soft ambient music playing perfect for a sunday afternoon we ordered the pho dac biet bo vien house phonomenal house special combination of sliced eye round steak welldone brisket welldone flank soft tendon tripe and beef meatball and the pho tai sliced eye round steak and goi cuon spring rolls as with most vietnamese restaurants the portion size of pho is quite large and we could have shared both were delicious filling and had a nice aroma but nothing too overpowering ive experienced a few places that use a little too much anise so much that you cant get an overall sense of all the delightful herbs and spices used in this delicious creation the spring rolls had a very fresh crisp flavor and were the perfect accompaniment to the pho i give pho ao sen 5 stars best pho ive had in the valley beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff makes me one happy girl
__label__1 we used the taco cart for my 30th birthday this past weekend and we came away very impressed eduardo was the guy that came to our fiesta and he was incredible when he arrived we experienced a haboob and he immediately stepped in and helped bring in our decorations and furniture he waited about 30 minutes until serving because we were unsure if the haboob was going to attack again my wife and i are both in the restaurant biz and so were many of the guests we all came away impressed with the food quality next time we throw a party we will use them again make sure to get the el pastor and carnitas great job hector eduardo
__label__1 this is one of my favorite theaters with that said i suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of preteen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a friday or saturday evening if youre like me safety is a concern not to worry here ive always seen an officer on premises during the main dropthekidsoff pickthekidsup window this location still has a new feeling to it and it is clean and cool nice cushy seats with cup holders and i have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as i walk down an aisle my favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front a place to perch my feet swoop
__label__1 i love cupcakes its true i really do i have waited in an hour long line outside of magnolia bakery in nyc to experience the bakery that started the cupcake craze that said if there is a good cupcake to be had im on my way to experience it i must note that i am not a fan of sprinkles as i think they are overly dry and waayy too hyped we just ordered two dozen different flavors from mind over batter to celebrate our august birthdays its a tradition we do once a month from bakers around town because of my love for all thinks coffee i got the carmel mocchiato let me just say i wished i took a picture but i couldnt help but to dive in mocha buttercream frostingpiled high crushed coffee toffee and carmel drizzle i also heard rave reviews from the office about the birthday cake and the chocolate red velvet the one i most want to try is the lemon drop because i love lemon ill be back in very soon to check out more flavors and cake pops
__label__1 every time i visit my parents i pass this place and see a long line of cars curiosity and a good set of luggage my parents found here finally convinced me to stop by well its a flea market wysiwyg theres the good nice luggage some nice jewelry some good foodstuffs the bad the same authentic southwestern stuff you find in any gift shop from san antonio to san diego and the ugly several i heart columbus beanie babies ill come back if im looking for something in particular chiefly luggage or salsa or want to get a souvenir for a relative i dont like very much
__label__1 this was supposed to be my trip to have the best pizza in america so imagine my disappointment that they dont even serve it at lunch what human who eats pizza thinks it should only be served at dinner whaaat i have since been kindly corrected by another yelper that this restaurant isnt the pizzeria my party was confused since the server said they do serve pizzaat dinner the soprassata focaccia sandwich was fine but overpriced by about 3 i dont live here to try it again so the first impression is the only impression ill leave it to all you foodie hipsters to prop up the rating
__label__0 im sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible chef aaron please come by and monitor your staff we had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster it was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate the shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality the beer menu looked fabulous so i guess if this is just a watering hole things will be finebut if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied we hope this turns around the decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpfuland we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the hood
__label__1 i saw the reviews of this arribas and thought to myself are these people talking about the same arribas i went to last night i went there and had an awesome time service was prompt and if something was off our server jeff who was amazing explained why something happened but didnt blame anyone and didnt use server jargon i do understand the jargon but it was nice for someone to not have to resort to it warm chips and salsas warm bean dip came out awesome and the spicy salsa was calling my name it burned but i loved it i ordered the rio grande enchiladas with the carne abodoba and ordered it extra spicy of course i would i was with my girl and she likes strawberry margaritas so we split the house margarita for 2 frozen with sugar of course im not a huge margarita person but it was really good she ordered the cheese enchiladas she takes safe choices when we go eat more on the margaritas in a min food come out and seriously it was some of the best spanishmexican ive had in a while its good to see an establishment take risks with seasoning their food it was fresh which is hard to find these days and im pretty sure the people who own arribas own a hatch chile farm because i rarely saw anything about jalapenos or serranos or even habaneros which is cool those hatch chiles are slanged around that place like coke in studio 54 in the 70s im not kidding when you order your entree and they ask you what kind of beans you want black pinto or the 3rd kind that is a combo of blackpinto with some onion tomatoes and of course whats that hatch chiles i highly recommend them i liked how arribas uses the hatch chiles it sets them apart it brought the heat after dinner i ordered another margarita this time i asked jeff of a recommendation why do i do this because the people that work at any restaurant know the fooddrinks there more than you will ever know nuff said he brought out some margarita i dont even know the name it kicked my ass thank god my girl was driving home thats all im going to say thanks thats why this place gets 5 stars it deserves it in my opinion i think because this place takes chances with seasoning and overall outlook is why so many people might be unhappy with arribas or this location in general i on the other hand promote this thought process i dont want food thats bland that a place kicks off the line to the people outside than enjoy bland food that makes for a bland place thats filled with well bland people this place uses heat salt pepper and other spices that i dont know of what a freaking great idea too hot for you then dont eat food that is 99 based on heat i will surely be going back and i wont have a bad time
__label__1 my wife and i just got married at blackstone and im still amazed at how awesome they are to work with elizabeth megan and alicia all worked tirelessly to make our wedding memorable the location couldnt have been better im still getting compliments on how beautiful it was we read the glowing reviews prior to booking and all i can say is that i agree with them 100
__label__1 if star of india soi is named after the historic ship that set sail from great britain to india then it is best to declare at the beginning that there is nothing worth remembering about this place and there is little that keeps you afloat in the morass of ordinary fare like many other indian restaurants in the valley the smell of indian cooking hangs in the air and permeates every piece of furnishing the place does not disappoint when it comes to service it is warm quick and attentive the complimentary papadums indian flatbread with homemade chutneys condiments is usually the high point of a meal at soi experiences with the order could be as follows gobi parantha indian bread stuffed with cauliflower the real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the soi parantha resembles a toppingless thin crust pizza lamb korma the gravy is thick nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes precooked chicken biriyani it is difficult to describe the godfood that is biryani but soi manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables disheartenment with the overpriced substandard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert finally as observed in other reviews and the menu if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and chefs specialities however in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost
__label__1 this dryrub barbecue was delicious the sassy barbecue sauce was meh but the sweet was good enough to make up for it
__label__1 tarbells is top notch in all areas food quality service ambience amazing i recently took ten business associates there for a meeting and i got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant definitely try the spaghetti meatballs as well as the mac n cheese and even the pizzas are to die for and the burger too you really cant go wrong here warning the deserts here are huge yet amazing one desert is enough for 23 people
__label__1 weve take our daughter to dr ramirez at tlc since we were released from the hospital ive seen all but one of the four doctors and have been extremely pleased with all of them they offer both a sick and well child waiting room our daughter loves the themed rooms with small children you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit my child is two now and we have never been unable to get an emergencysick appointment our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day anything they told us they were doing was done as promised i cannot recommend them highly enough
__label__1 wow is this some fantastic food it was the first non chain restaurant we ate at during our vacation and i couldnt be more pleased not only was the staff friendly and attentive the food was phenomenal presentation and taste were top notch the tai fried rice was the best fried rice ive ever had i will definitely be back the next time im in town visit date 111809
__label__1 i would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come and if youre in town and looking for a great local nonchain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should then try cibo i took my man here for mystery date night as a surprise since he had never been no wait at 845 on a friday night yes take that pizzeria b and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool i love the atmosphere of the patio also lit with those great offwhite lights and fire pits we shared the burrata which was gynormus easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us the wine was tasty and reasonable i was drinking a pinot grigio and my guy had the house chianti which i never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine until i tried cibos house version it was very good definitely not from grandmas now for the pizza it is just perfection it has that amazing combination of char on the crust crispy on the outside chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings it almost melts in your mouth its not heavy at all its nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint so we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella ricotta and a scoop of ice cream on top i dont typically die over dessert its my boyfriends thing im an app girl but this it wasnt too sweet it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness i would never eat here without dessert again i have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour but they dont fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why i prefer that here you will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date hell maybe even a mystery one
__label__0 this place was messy and loud the food really wasnt great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food i will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
__label__0 i had every intention of giving this place a chance mostly because it doesnt look like the kind of place that people rave about after a meal sometimes making a snap judgment is completely justified we were intially given a server that was not at all confident in her ability to perform her job even at the most basic of levels when she was asked about the specials she shrugged her shoulders and told us she didnt know about the ingredients or sides that were available i was still hanging in there and giving this place my all afterall she could have been new having a terrible day or goodness knows what she was going through that day then the baby started screaming in the booth next to us and every server in the place ran for the hills leaving the issue unaddressed people if you have a crying baby for the love take the poor little thing outside and deal with the problem dont force unsuspecting strangers to listen to it we opted for a changed of scenery within the restaurant after five minutes of nonstop crying and were moved into the main area of the restaurant and reassigned to a new server she no sooner finished warming my coffee i use this term loosely as it was more like colored water before i glanced into the grill area which open for the whole restaurant to see this was the nightmare i saw a rather large female cook with a tissue paper plug in her nose anyone whos ever had a bloody nose knows that this is one of the few things you can do to passify the dripping blood you would think a bloody nose would qualify one for a break until the bleeding subsided wouldnt you i dont think ill be able to bring myself to visit this place again in the mean time might i suggest some food safety training
__label__0 how very disappointing nellos had a delightful menu with an array of salads pizzas and sandwiches not jacs if the new restaurant wants to be a pub it should have a wider variety of selections the menu was sad due to dietary restrictions i asked for a plain garden salad lettuce tomatoes and onions and it wasnt very fresh either sad guess well be driving up north to pima crossing to visit nellos
__label__1 this was my go to vietnamese restaurant for pho and rice plates not because its my favorite but because of convenience pho avina is closer to me but that place is terrible so i end up going to this place it also helps that leelee supermarket is one street over so i get a viet fix and my asian needs shopping in one trip the pho and com tam is average the service is fast and friendly enough i do find it a big stingy that they dont bring out the bowl of brothsoup before you get your rice plate unless you ask for it all in all this place is fine if you just want an average meal nothing to rave about here if i felt like driving farther id definitely hit up pho van in chandler for pho or com tam thuan kieu in mesa for com tam
__label__1 clean comfortable smokefree fast service nice staff also their complimentary breakfast had a nice variety of food items there is juice and coffee bagels yogurts waffles and cereals the hotel was a lot nicer than i expected and i would definitely stay here again
__label__0 ok so i think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me i just flew home from israel on this airlines boy they are pretty sad i usually dont like to be too harsh on anyone but this airlines deserves it please dont think of this review as complaining but rather a warning to others out there to never fly us airways nobody likes a complainer right haha well not never but if you have no other choice i would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered you could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par i guess i have been spoiled with the likes of hawaiian airlines nippon airlines shoot you can even throw delta in there the flight attendants are rude this is from both personal experience and from observation of my own you know what i could go on and on but i really dont like to cry about stuff would i fly us airways again no way if it was one of the last airlines on earth maybe i just hope that their service of customers get better then again maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that i hadnt shaved and looked talibanish oops
__label__1 im a loyal patron of steves krazy subs so i dont want to get involved in a family rivalry however sandwiches are my business and they deserve a fair critique regardless at first approach neds is much more of a professional looking sub shop nice large dining area clean fancy tables more on those in a minute i was glad to see that neds had the same lunch special8 in poorboy chips and drink1 more at neds but you get bigger chips tasted exactly the same so tough to compare my only complaint is the booths probably great if you are 65 but for common folk pretty uncomfy
__label__1 so for my date tonight to the compass room i needed to get my nails done i removed my acrylics myself last week i read the reviews here and decided to try dv you know sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time its almost like the soup nazi not this place there were two girls ahead of me so i waited a bit but only about ten minutes its bigger than the place i had been going to really clean and i heard english being spoken by the nail techs that was nice yeah there were still speaking vietnamese or so i think to each other yes probably about us gringas but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations i had le she was so sweet i told her all about my date too she was quick and made some suggestions about what to get usually i like clear tips that they have to paint i was kinda short on time so i went with her suggestion of white tips plus it was about 5 cheaper she was quick but really methodical i think this may be the nicest set of acrylics ive gotten out here in the phx she even called me by name throughout the conversation 25 for a new full set not bad at all
__label__1 we have had nothing but good luck at this franchise so far weve been here probably a dozen times its always clean and the food is fresh and the way it ought to be yum
__label__0 i love saddle ranch for its casual night time festivities including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe but i cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting when i think of my meal this past friday night i think of two words dry and cold the spinach artichoke dip was just okay a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy the onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at mcdonalds maybe even worse the bbq burger turkey patty was dry and tasteless as was the bacon really it must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless there are a few things that the menu has going for itself a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that i have yet to see elsewhere i am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and though im not much of a beer drinker the beer tower looks pretty badass for me i came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere but i will definitely be staying away from the grub adios cowboy
__label__1 perfect location for breakfast before sf giants spring training game also perfect location for drinks and snacks after the game enjoyed 3 meals in two days and will recommend to all my friends
__label__1 the phoenix hooters is directly opposite the sheraton downtown hotel where i was staying was really hungry and didnt want to eat at the hotel so decided to give hooters a try hooters girls are always a nice touch i really liked this location since there was a lot of outside seating the food is what you expect from hooters i had the pulled pork sandwich with fries it was good but then i was very hungry food quality was good and arrived quickly cant ask for anything more hooters girl was also cute i would come back with a crowed of guy for a drink and burger prices are very reasonable
__label__1 pauli from atl checking in here just for a bit of nostalgia i used to live in phoenix a few years back and of all the places i miss eating at this is 1 on my list i remember how i first heard of the place i was over at a friends house in scottsdale having a few beers after work and remember asking him what his favorite mexican restaurant in phoenix was my friend who had more than just a few beers in him stared at me all glassyeyed got right in my face and said cheeeeno banddddeeedo as i backed up a bit thinking my friend had too much to drink he had for sure i wondered hmmmthe chinese bandit what the hell is that place about or is he just fing with me so i asked him what kind of food they serve there and as he did his best to focus on me when his eyes hit mine there was this long pause and he had this expression on his face that i cant forget i wasnt sure if he was having trouble putting it into words or if he was shing in his pants and then he put his hands together like a nutjob working a rubiks cube and said they dooo things like eggfoooo youngggg burrritos and jaaaade red chicken tacossssss as he gave me another crazyass look the kind that tells you its time to say goodnight and get outta there which i did so a few days later i remembered his drunken explanation of chino bandido and thought i would go check the place out and from that point on i was hooked egg foo young burritos indeed and jerk fried rice and those refried black beans with fireinthebungholio sauce mixed in yep those will burn you twice all served in a giant disposable aluminum baking dish and you got that combo along with a soda and tip for about 10 wow at that time i had never seen anything like it before and i still miss eating there more than any of my favorite old haunts in phoenix i wish somebody would franchise one out to atlanta i would be the first customer in the door on opening day guaranteed
__label__1 ive been frequenting the dollar store for the past three weeks while shopping for a work project i have bought just about every pair of safety scissors in phoenix playdough and other small manipulatives for elementary reading and math kids anytime i need cleaning supplies for home i head straight to this dollar tree store they have the best carpet cleaner called las totally awesome carpet spot and stain remover it really works the dollar tree is a great place to stock up on cheap party decorations shopping at the dollar tree is kinda like buying a saturn you know the price before you walk in and how much youre going to spend before you check out i love that
__label__1 aiellos is my favorite italian spot in the valley in fact i day dream about the mushroom ravioli special you can taste the love in this dish great ambiance and a wonderful experience the staff are always attentive and professional the owner makes a stop or two to make sure youre having a good time and they even let chance decide who pays for dinner you or the house helpful hint try no to get stuffed on the tasty bread and hot peppers served before the entree youre going to want to finish it
__label__1 this place is as good as id heard we came here for a daylate birthday dinner for my middle daughterfathers day dinner for her husband she and his sixyear old daughter ordered a hawaiian style with pineapple and ham he and i got the margherita pizza with garlic tomatoes olive oil fresh basil mozzarella and romano cheese both were so delicious he also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all dipped in either of two great sauces ranch or marinara the pizzas were about 13 each for the larges i usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good i couldnt resist taking a third piece at this place the decor was pretty and the service was greatthe server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything i would definitely be a regular if i lived near here on a side note next door is the aloha kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good 62010
__label__1 pretty yummy i just went here for lunch and thought the pricing was the best feature 695 for all entrees which includes a bowl of spicy chicken soup not sure of name i ordered the panang with pork and loved it it had great flavor and the serving size was appropriate for lunch dont let the restaurants outside appearance scare you the inside is not too bad the servers were very nice and efficient ill be back guaranteed because they serve quickly and it works for my lunch hour

__label__1 i was in phoenix on business and im allways looking for some good eats i found this place with the help of yelp and food network app on my i phone i originally planned on getting the waffle that everyone raved about but ended up getting the special andouille sausage scramble spicy but very good hash browns were good and i also liked the sour dough toast when i go back im definatly gonna try the waffle be ready to wait for a seat it doesnt seem very big singles get seated faster because they have counter style seating
__label__1 monkey pants has some of the best burgers in az great place for a long lazy lunch over some pitchers i think one month my friends and i went there like 20 times for lunch never got sick of it its a dive bar but its a cool dive bar
__label__0 i have been here about 3 times twice for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch the food is similar to dennys so nothing special here everything here feels dingy and dirty there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet service is average but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurantwill not be coming here anymore

__label__1 hate long lines at the dmv hate dealing with the dmv for any reason then you should check out desert title service i had a complicated title transfer and was dreading spending 4 hours at the dmv office the last day of the month but i knew i had to do it so today my daughter and i went over to dmv and waited an hour before deciding to call desert title service had i known i could go in to a place with no lines get a title release and a title transfer i would have checked them out sooner i called their office while sitting in the dmv and drove over in less then 15 minutes i had the title released and the title transferred daughter had new plates and her title in less then 5 if you need anything to do with your car i urge you to call them andor visit their office you will be surprised at how fast and efficient their office is i will never visit the dmv unless i have to
__label__1 yummy we would go to canters in la before i moved out here so this is a good comparable pastrami sandwich very close to where we live which is great prices are fine a bit pricey but oh well overall thumbs up
__label__1 i have been craving some soul food for quite some time so i kicked and screamed til someone finally took me to lolos after memorizing the menu for weeks i knew i wanted the baby ray so we go in and i was overjoyed that they had a band playing some sweet grooves i jammed out a lil while waiting for about 10 minutes we were seated in a nice lil half boothtable combo and had a huge jar of koolaid and sweet tea delivered to us yum i starting getting the biggest sugar rush halfway through the wait when my food did arrive i was presented with two waffles bigger than my face 3 big pieces of chicken smothered in enough gravy and onions to fill a whole gravy boat the chicken was spectacular really good flavor and crispwhen not soaked in gravy get it on the side gravy was pretty good as well the waffles were alright i cant say i am the biggest waffle fan but the subtle cinnamon flavor was nice i think the waffles could have been better in my opinion i am kicking myself for not trying the grits and collared greens or the red velvet cake i could not finish my second waffle though so much food couldnt even think the service was probably a b the hostess was bubbly and sweet our server was busy and a little frazzled maybe the server gave us the wrong change and seemed to not believe that she had waiting for the correction was longer than average for sure overall though i had a good time perfect way to end my weekend
__label__1 picazzos pizza is excellente my wife and i were told about this little pizza place by a friend who swore by it so we decided to try it out we are sooooo glad that we did because the food quality taste was amazing my wife loves it so much that when i asked her where she wanted to go for her birthdaydr weils restaurant in scottsdale or picazzosguess which one she chose picazzos ftw the prices are a little on the high side but i am a firm believer in the saying you get what you pay for this pizza place was worth every penny

__label__1 im giving them a 5 star review for how they handled a poor experience we had my family came here for my brothers birthday a few weeks back and two of our four dishes came out undercooked we brought it to the attention of our waitress who brought the manager adrienne over they both apologized profusely and took the charges off of our bill which is what i would expect we were polite and appreciative of their apology and really didnt expect or ask for anything else however they also offered to give us a credit to come back another time so they could prove to us that it was just a one time mistake we took them up on the offer and sure enough the food was excellent the second time around our server was fantastic adrienne came by to make sure we were happy and the chef even came out to make sure we were pleased with the meal they really went above and beyond to make sure we left with a positive opinion of their restaurant everybody makes a mistake once and awhile but not everyone has such excellent customer service to correct it i will gladly return here as a result
__label__1 fabulous holy kobe beef burger with avocado bacon and cheese it was the special of the day i didnt care what it cost i knew i had to have it come to think of it that was the first time in my life ive never ordered off the menu and actually went for the of the day i did it with my wine too i wasnt a huge fan of the parmesan fries but i could be alone here all in all great place for some burger lovin the milkshakes at the other table looked unreal
__label__1 when shopping is an adventure and a destination you must be heading to tan phat this is a funky asian market that has been there for me whenever i need water chestnuts for wrapping in bacon and they carry five different brands who knew so many companies were in the business of the water chestnut or kitchen supplies for asian themed dinners one of the first things that hits you upon entering in the smell of seafood after acclimating to that youll find a huge selection of canned goods dried seafood and mushrooms a decent selection of fresh produce and an ample amount of novelty edibles you know those intriguingly package foodstuffs that you just cant find outside of asian markets the employees are usually polite you may have to walk through every aisle to find what you need but thats part of the adventure
__label__1 i freakin love this place my favorite thing is to sit and eat facing the counter and watch new people come in and get all confused now thats just funny my first time i was the same way like what the hell do i do here now im a pro stack it deep and use another bowl for smashing soba noodles piled so high it looks like a circus act getting the bowl to the cook mmmmgood
__label__1 really great food and service and it worked out just fine for my two kids ages 7 and 10 meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels the food came very quickly we had all small plates and pizza not entrees kale chips fried chickpeas peppers mozzarella salad dessert was great the mousse was first rate and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious though we couldnt taste any parsnip it just tasted like excellent flavorful creme brulée one of the best meals we had in arizona and we also really liked the decor simple elegant and also funcreative not sure why anyone would ding them for that also the portion sizes were just fine we all left full but not feeling gross were from ma and were unaware of the chefs celebrity i wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing or a reaction against some sort of hype im outside that loop but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension just thorough competence note its a nice walk from the arizona biltmore hotel under 2 miles
__label__1 my daughter has been attending gold medal swim school since february the instructors are great they always take the time to say hello outside of class and they are very caring the class ratio is fantastic with a max of 31 in each beginner starfish class currently the price is 72month which includes 1 class per week during the spring and summer and the ability to schedule unlimited classes per week from octoberfebruary the school also routinely sends emails for a free class when there is same day availability usually with newer instructors the only reason i am leaving this at 4 stars is that my daughter has struggled with swim lessons in the indoor pool because some of the sky lights are not coveredfiltered she is very sensitive to light and i am concerned she may not be able to progress with the way the skylights are currently only time will tell the management at gold medal is top notch which is probably why they retain such happy employees overall i am very pleased with gold medal and yes the owners were gold medal olympians
__label__1 food is good dont take kids though kids pasta was 7 with no accompaniments
__label__1 who woulda thunkkkk scottsdale az would have such amazing soul food they surprised the hell outta me coming from someone who regulars roscoes chicken waffles believe me when i say lolos is bomb i got the 3chicken combo w greens maccheese cornbread cornbread hands down roscoes greens roscoes maccheese lolos for suuuree chicken tied theyre both really good the staff is super friendly cant wait to go back when i visit az
__label__1 another place thats walking distance subway is one of those places where you cant go wrongyou got 5dollar value meals or foot longs the guys are really friendly and arent stingy with the toppings im not a big fan of the smell subways have though eh anyways its just one of those places where im lazy and dont want to make a sandwichplus it helps me keep my girlish figure like jared
__label__1 at first i was disappointed with padres menu i usually get tacos rice and beans and they only had soft tacos but then i ventured out and got this amazing beef burrito that came with rice and beans really glad i tried it i was also pleased to see that they had sol beer on the menu it is my favorite mexican cerveza and i usually cant find it in restaurants
__label__1 i just went here for lunch i really have nothing to add to the other reviews on here because they pretty much all sum it up it gets crowded the ordering process is a clusterfuk they place looks sketchy and dirty the staff is very friendly and helpful yada yada the place isnt worth all the hype but definitely is worth a visit if you are in the mood for something unique its not the healthiest or highest quality cuisine but it is a pretty solid place and worth a shot jerk chicken very good pollo diablo spicy and awesome and my stomach is going to hate me later jade red chicken excellent pork fried rice very good red salsa stuff excellent refried beans standard snickerdoodle cookie awesome
__label__1 gracies is a small thrift store with decent items the prices are a little less than you would pay at goodwill you can get a pair of jeans for about 5 if you need a belt this would be a good place to go only 2 i didnt find anything to buy for myself but we found a new pair of shorts for my son only 250 just an fyi it costs 075 to use your debit card
__label__1 what a great little find especially for phoenix ive been there on at least 4 occasions and have never been disappointed and just had to let everybody know about this little gem recently i took my mother and we had delicious singapore noodles and malaysian rice noodles which are kind of like thais rad na but better on another occasion my husband ordered pork belly curry and really loved it i wasnt as adventurous and had delicious chicken kebab burmese style family owned quiet and very affordable you have to really look for this place since its in a shopping centerits on the north side of shea between 70th 71st st in scottsdale great early bird dinners as well
__label__1 a nice place to shop but i wouldnt want to live there i never used to be a department store shopper but recently ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better go figure while i still like getting a deal i usually wait until there is a clearance or sale or some type the macys at scottsdale fashion square seems to have more selection such as more size options for the items you seem to like and a few more items to choose from also for guys i would suggest checking out the dillards at fashion square the mens dept is about the size of this entire macys store 2 or 3 times a year dillards has an awesome clearance event and you can pickup 65 off clearance prices which are usually already 50 70 off the original price i digress this is supposed to be a review of macys if youre in the biltmore area and looking for higher end quality shopping go ahead and check them out then travel down camelback to fashion square mall when they tell you the item you like is only available in your size at a different store
__label__1 this review is based on an event i attended here i did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar i was a guest at the etiquette dinner put on by asu and affiliates from the moment i entered the hotel i felt welcomed each employee i passed greeted me with a smile and professionality i thought the hotel interior was really cool also when i was leaving the event i thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities i should try it
__label__1 ok its a chain so theres that but im like broman and we luv us a good sammich and capriottis didnt disappoint there i went at an odd time and had the place to myself it was quite clean and instead of just hanging out bsing the people were busy taking care of the place so the menu short and sweet thats how i like it unlike a place like the friggin cheezecake crapory with its 80000 menu items none of them done well capriottis keeps it under control and turns out a tasty sammy i had the turkey sub with spicy peppers mmm mmmm i love the fresh roasted turkey like that and the just like grandma made pickles well not like either of my grandmas made but someones grandma the veggies passed the fresh crispy test with flying colors and the sub roll was perfectly soft and chewy ya its slightly on the higher end fast sandwich price range but its quality and pretty filling i made 2 meals out of the 9 with the meal deal right around 10 i have a groupon for the place and cant wait to take my good friend and get him hooked next victim on my list the bobbie
__label__1 large goodwill location formally a petsmart but dark like a cave this one is hit or miss it is clean for a goodwill ive seen some pretty dirty ones just need to keep checking to find the treasures here
__label__1 i came here on saturday becuase i had to get my jeep serviced and i wanted to check this dealership out i made an appointment and dropped my jeep off in the sevice bay i was greeted when i walked into the dealer and i had a decent experience here i do have to say that i didnt like waiting 3 hours but that seems to be at most any dealership you go to for warranty work so i cannot blame them for that what i dont like is going for service and tying to be sold on a new vehicle im in for service not to buy or trade in my car why do the salesman do that i know its thier job to sell but not every single time geez annoying
__label__1 awesome bartender on the patio way great drink specials dont come here to have conversations folks its loud great dj spinning crazy dance music place gets way crowded so get there early and snag a spot to people watch
__label__0 i am furious in the last 12 months i have had at least scheduling issues from them calling me at 8am on a saturday morning my 1 day off to cancel my 11am appointment to last saturday when i went in only to be told someone had messed up and actually booked me for the next week and despite me driving all the way out there at 11am they couldnt get me in until maybe that evening and then not with someone who had experience in deep tissuemedical massage i was irritate and ready to ask for my membership refunded then but ashley the clinic manager promised me that theyd give me my next week appointment free of charge and that shed personally be certain there were no more issues as i literally couldnt turn my head to the left due to pain i took her up on that big mistake yesterday the friday before my correctly scheduled massage i went out of my way to call in and confirm my own bloody appointment to try and avoid last weeks debacle according to the woman who answered the phone it looked like my schedule therapist was actually scheduled off but she went to talk with her manager and came back to the phone telling me everything was ok and that shed call with any issues then yesterday evening i got another confirmation call from massage envy confirming and reminding me of my 1130am appt on saturday with my preferred therapist given that ive had 3 migraines this week versus my 0 or 1 when i get a massage the weekend prior i really absolutely needed to get in so i felt more confident well i was just woken up at 8amagain on my day offagain to explain to me that big shock they messed up my scheduling again and that apparently my therapist was off today despite ashleys promise of it not happening again despite me being proactive and calling to confirm i am sitting here in pain so furious at this repeated treatment that i cant even go back to bedand the best part they dont even have a manager on duty i can complain to my treatment at the hands of the bookingfront desk staff has been any thing but relaxing i continue to walk out of there frustrated angry and occasionally in tears i know they say fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me but i was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt im pretty screwed for today and the next week but luckily an elements place with a similar concept opened recently in the general area at this point it literally cannot be any worse than massage envy as much as i love talisha and aisha as massage therapists getting a massage should feel good and not like youre just a number to them not like you actually have to spend more time trying to get a damn appointment than you actually get to spend in the appointment
__label__1 joined smunchphoenix at galloblanco for my first breakfast at gallo i ordered chilaquiles verde and my girlfriend had the chorizo and eggs we were both very happy with our choices the chilaquiles was delicious with the crispy corn tortillas providing a nice contrast the chorizo and eggs were definitely in line with what i consider to be authentic i am definitely a fan of gallo and will return as often as time and money allow
__label__1 i grew up at this library and now i am old and married and hope to someday take my very own kids to this library they have a great selection of audio books i am a major audio book fan and this is the place to be clean safe you are not bothered by stranger dangers i dig this library
__label__1 theres no better way to find out about a new eatery than to receive a gift card to one youve never been to or heard of for that matter this happened to me when i received a gift card to paradise bakery being new to phoenix of course i yelpd it to find one nearby i located this on on the swc of bell rd and 7th street while up at sams club paradise bakery has sandwiches salads soups sides and of course the bakery items at this location you can eat in or take out i like the turkey bacon bravo or the turkey cranberry with a side of their excellent mac n cheese and a drink getting this combo also scores you a free cookie this location is in the shopping area with a huge target and many other stores so the parking is hit or miss depending on the time of dayweek and pbs prices are just a bit steep for what they servegood food but still a bit pricey
__label__1 i was looking for a place where i could get new tires and an oil change that was near home luckily there is an advanced auto service and tire center south of old town scottsdale on thomas rd i initially went in for two new tires but ended up getting four new tires since all tires were the original ones from when i bought the car fortunately i am getting a 80 rebate on the tires which is a good thing considering the cost of the goodyear tires it took about 90 minutes to get the four new tires installed in addition to an oil change i worked with jason and he provided excellent customer service from inspecting my tires to recommending the best tires
__label__1 this place is strictly a dessert place while they serve food i would skip the food and go right to the dessert at least that is what i do being that i have only eaten dessert at this place i have been here 3 times all of which have been very good my only complaint is that the sundaes are a little pricey and the decor is pretty dated but it is an authentic retro ice cream parlor the sundaes are always made up to perfection they have many unique flavors and i have enjoyed each one next time you are in need for a sugar fix give this place a try
__label__1 ive been going to this costco location since i was a tyke when it used to be called price club and my parents carted me around in their giant warehouse sized shopping carts those were the days and those huge carts were the coolest to sit in the employees here are nice and friendly for the most part and there are employees i see when im here that i remember from when i was in junior high a testament to the happiness of the staff here if theyve been at this location for so long
__label__1 although a bit pricey hence the 4 stars the martinis are great as is the food the cobb salad is the best ive ever had good service cool crowd cant wait until i can go back which sadly is not soon enough now that i live in san diego
__label__1 amazing place i had the swordfish with pasta and fresh veggies delicious great service although the check was a little late the waiter brough amaretto on the rocks to apologize
__label__1 wow i dont think ive ever been in a more narrow place ever but it was just perfect in ever way they have tables along one side and a bar with tall stools along the other side you can watch them make your food its like the food network but live and you can smell it my coworker and i sat right in front of the oven every time they would open the oven i would only get hungrier we could see all the fresh and yummy ingredients i had the reuben pastrami corned beef homemade sauerkraut and swiss with a side of 1000 island dressing wow it was amazing for their sauerkraut they use red cabbage it was more sweet than bitter and the crust of the pasty was flaky and buttery so delicious and i honestly forgot how much i love corned beef over all it was very rich but great to share my coworker had the italian pepperoni salami ham mozzarella basil tomatoes and marinara sauce it looked great he loved it you could see the fresh basil and tomatoes it smelled divine we didnt speak for a full 20 minutes just barley loud enough mmmmmmmms and omg this is amazing said quietly to ourselves all of the employees were so outgoing and laid back at the same time just really cool guys i loved the atmosphere and the attitudes that filled this place i cannot wait to come back
__label__1 i love this place we werent sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza kinda weird but the employees in the other businesses are lucky we went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome yelp reviews our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didnt rush us while we were checking out the menu options i ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans he also ordered a side of ribs to sample the wait wasnt too bad it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go they are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it which is awesome because the sauce tastes so good its a nice thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from we go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs we pack everything up and go back to get those the employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs we repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husbands order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich we decide to let it go and eat our food the pulled pork has great flavor the meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce however we werent going that route because the sauce is too damn good not to eat the baked beans and macaroni cheese were not anything special but they were good the ribs were our favorite part we absolutely loved them very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious this place is pretty far from where we live but we would definitely go out of our way again to eat here more
__label__1 this is obviously the mecca of the phoenician mountain hikes and deservedly so camelback is the perfect mix of central location unparalleled views and most importantly a grueling workout i love hiking this mountain because of the mix of rock types it starts out as red rock near the base up to the hella scary rails then very suddenly changes to a granite lookalike anyone know if thats actually granite about halfway up it sure looks like it the last leg is bascially boulders that you have to crawl over but the view at the top is an unbeatable 360degree view of the valley though south mountain has a more centralized view on camelback you really feel on top of the whole valley my only complaints first the parking is a nightmare especially on the weekends perhaps its just due to its reputation and the surplus of multimilliondollar homes in the area but it can be hard to find a spot plus people like to jockey for position on those rails especially coming down so be careful you dont take a tumble
__label__1 rally burger is a pretty great alternative to mcds or bk and its somewhat unfortunate that there arent more locations in the phoenix area their seasoned fries are awesome and even better with chili what i was really impressed with though is their value burger selection and flavor a simple rally burger is a buck and change and seems like some of the nonvalue burgers at other fast food good condiment to meat ratio and flavorful and no skimping hereyou get all the condiments even on a value burger lettuce tomato pickle onionall that the other thing i really liked was they have a value buffalo chicken burger which was actually really tasty all in all yes its fast food but its a different flare with unique options and arguably better quality in some areas
__label__1 everyone knows about pei wei right i really thought so until my boyfriend admitted that he had never been challenge accepted now ive been a frequent pei wei customer ever since i discovered asian food did not always have to send to you running to the restroom yeah thanks for nothing bing heng and great wall buffet this isnt the best asian food ever but it is quick accessible and always pretty tasty ive tried everything on the menu but my favorite options are the crab wontons and the pei wei spicy chicken i ordered these plus the spicy korean for my n00b boyfriend to try and everything went better than expected in fact he even commented that the place was classier than he expected just a side note you can order and pay online so you dont have to wait for the takeout line you can also choose the specific time you would like to pick up your food
__label__1 eyebrows are a very touchy subject im literally convinced that unless you make some serious cash finding an excellent and meticulous aesthetician is like finding a needle in a haystack well yelpers ive been searching in this haystack for three months too long and each time i leave thinking they really dont listen to what i requested and i wasted money so i decided no longer was i going to leave spending 2000 tip included on mediocre brows i went back to doing my own and i am completely satisfied plus the music selection is terrible a positive its neat that they text you a 24 hour reminder notice however you better be sure you show up because they do charge fees for tardies and noshows
__label__1 on a friday night restaurant was busy but the service was top drawer food was very good and we will be back prices reasonable
__label__1 i love a greasy burger joint so i wanted to try smashburger i took my order to go the layout of the store is different than most burger placea rather minimalist front counter the service was quick and i received my food in a reasonble amount of time it was hot and fresh i ordered the 13 smashburger with everything and smashfries the burger was ok it was spiced in the same way that hamburger works or the chuckhouse does their burgers the veggies on the burger were fresh the bun started to fall apart about the time i finished the burger overallit was just ok it aint no lenny burger id rather go to fatburger then smashburger the fries were crispy and flavored they were good when i first saw them i thought the portion was rather small but when i took it out of the box in which they came it appeared to be a normal portion i wont avoid the place if people want to go therebut i wont make a special trip
__label__1 i came in on an early friday morning to buy a dozen and a half of donuts for my co workers the man behind the counter found it odd i order such an amountapparently by the way he repeated my order in my case 1 dozen would have been too little 2 dozen too many and i didnt want to waste any that alrady made me feel uncomfortable just fulfill whatever order you get i am customer it was my first time here after many many drive bys he asked me what flavors and suggested to make a mix i didnt have a preference as i just liked an assortment again i was frowned upon just give me your bestselling flavorswhats the problem well i guess it was once and never again the donuts were fresh tasting but the service was far beyond friendly to bad you could have earned a new customer
__label__0 have been to the garage twice now and they are batting 1 for 2 went there on a saturday for lunch and the food and service was excellent i had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potatoe fries which was original for pulled pork served on a pizza crust bun my girlfriend had the buffalo chicken salad which was really good grilled chicken in buffalo sauce on top of baby greens excellent beer selection went there on a friday for happy hour and got there a little before 6 there was a 30 min wait for a indoor table or immediate seating on the patio so we decided to sit on the patio hostess sat us and said a server will be by shortly normal procedure about 10 minutes later no server had come by and the hostess returned and asked us if we ave been helped yet we said no so the hostess said she will get someone another 10 minutes and no server it wasnt busy on the patio about 5 tables occupied all with food and drink we decided that they must not want our business so we went next door to sushi eye will try again just wont sit on the patio
__label__1 absolutely fabulous espresso place the owner and staff are gracious and friendly but most importantly they get coffee i didnt have to explain how to make an espresso macchiato they just made it perfectly ill be here every time i visit chandler
__label__1 im happy to report these cows gave their best for me to eat thank you dear moo cows thank you these burgers are meaty goodness recently i went to a lunch with my bf her sis and ma on the fly for her bday since her first choice failed to be open on a sunday afternoon not her fault their site said they would be open bastards shaking my fist in the air didnt update the site d o u b l e grrrrr i suggested zin since we were in the proximity so this is my 3rd time at this place while pricey the portions of everything are large in charge good the ingredients are fresh the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion note to your mother do not waste the fat gym time on the creme brulee shake its nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake having said that i am a creme brulee fan so that may have been its downfall i was expecting greatness and fireworks etc i got a really good vanilla shake though dont get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake dont market it as a creme brulee shake how to improve it and bring a tear to my eye put a creme brulee hat on it gimmie the crunchy sweet im looking for expect and demand just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake the best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone online and having them show up and its clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile it is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally the banana cream pie shake is delish and the zin burger a def go if you want a healthy choice go for the tuna also very good and served perfectly rare mmmmm mmmm good
__label__0 back from holiday and had some amazing soups that made me reflect back on my experience here i have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and im sure has the best intentions but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking as a proponent of organics i had my hopes way too high well first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated the owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion to keep this review to the point we ordered a smoothie bland a frittata very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave need i say more two bowls of soup one was a bean with kale unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop the other a red pepper concoction that another diner suggested was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love when paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality culinary creation these soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks i would like to offer a suggestion that may help her so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front and that is to consider a different style of service the place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard if readable and then deliver the orders i wish her the best in her endeavor
__label__1 very dated but clean fine for a one night stop on road trip free coffee in morning cookies at night bathroom tiny
__label__1 i have been to st francis twice once for brunch and once for dinner the brunch deserves 5 stars we had great service and great food their bread was amazing we had great service for dinner but the food wasnt up to what i was expecting things were a little bland and the sauces on all the dishes was a little heavy however overall i would definitely recommend them
__label__1 hands down the best breakfast ive had in tempephoenix we arrived on a sunday morning around 9am and had no wait for a table the service was friendly and attentive a few slip ups on forgetting things in the kitchen eg bringing someones toast but our waitress was great everyone in our party loved their food i had the vatican skillet which we still cant figure out why its called the vatican and blueberry pancakes others had the three musketeers omelette and the breakfast burrito all of the food was awesome and then there was the brandied blackberry bread pudding dessert oh my god i dont even have the words to describe it at least not words that are appropriate for yelp it alone is worth a trip to this restaurant ill be back not soon enough
__label__0 tried this place multiple times many different items the only thing worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service
__label__1 maybe it was the authentic gospel music in the background but our ears were filled with a heavenly chorus as we feasted upon the sacred and until this morning unknown pairing of chicken and wafflesa combination rivaled by only bread and wine in its ability to induce a religious experience
__label__1 i really try to like old town scottsdale and if you look past all the godawful tourist traps it is actually quite a nice place with a number of top notch dining options but in the end you can only walk by so many massproduced native jewelry shops with bargains before it all starts blending together parking is generally a travesty but can be found if youre willing to wait it out and the public art is a nice touch for my dollar go grab a spot and kill some time at cartel grab some local foods at bodega and maybe consider a bite at one of the locally owned restaurants like fnb or praying monk and skip any place with turquoise jewelry in the window while focusing on the galleries that dont quite seem to fit the theme
__label__1 lots of awesome stores expensive and normal priceit is an indoor mall has starbucks and a tiffanysmy two favorites
__label__1 this spicy chicken soup is a must have when sick always makes me feel better when my hubby brings it home for me
__label__1 fantastic absolutely fantastic i recommend ohso for anyone looking to dine at a neighborhood bar and grill i was really shocked when i dined at ohso for a sunday brunch i figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery boy was i wrong this place has some of the best dishes in scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer let me say this with more clarity great food differentiates this place not the huge variety of beers this is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food the burger cheese is simply awesome a great brunch dish is the breakfast burrito as well as the breakfast flatbread
__label__1 my boyfriend and i were in arizona on vacation for a wedding the food was better than the average deli and they give you a free cookie with your order too it is a shame they dont have these in malls near me although i read on their website that they have one at the galleria which would have been nice when i lived in davis ca for college shopping really works up an appetite and this satisfied it well and light enough not to ruin a dinner as we had a wedding to attend later that evening
__label__1 oh yogurtlandwhy cant i resist your calling i had to run an errand and saw this location next to a fedex officeperfect i dropped in and ordered double cookies cream strawberry and cheesecaketopped with peanuts captain crunch and reeses peanut butter cup for around 490 httpwwwyelpcombizphotosco4cqnwyayv7hw8jkcekjgselectvcouxvxq0sl310xrxn9hog httpwwwyelpcombizphotosco4cqnwyayv7hw8jkcekjgselect8xzd9ms7yvnaeavn1irgsq it was of course awesome the line was very short tooeven though the weather was in the mid90sboy did i luck out return factor 100
__label__1 garlic roasted potatoes check amazing hummus and baba ganoush check cute waitresses some of which are babes check inexpensive menu with quality ingredients check there are many mediterranean restaurants around tempe that vary in quality and service pita jungle seems to break the mold theres something for everyone on their menu be it the mediterranean chicken salad or the glazed chicken lavosh pizza both are awesome pita jungle is located off of apache blvd very close to the campus of arizona state university while this location is a favorite along the student body a good mix of locals and students come here the waitresses are very friendly and especially professional for a restaurant that serve so many college students like i mentioned above many of the waitresses are super cute here is a meal of champions that i personally recommend 1 start off with the baba ganoush with chicken this is not on the menu but hummus with chicken is so just as for this you get a large portion of freshly made baba ganoush covered with chopped roasted chicken this is delicious 2 for your main course order the lavosh shawarma wrap this is chicken breast with grilled tomatoes and onions with garlic sauce in a crispy pita wrap lavosh this comes with a greek salad but theyll be happy to sub the salad for the garlic roasted potatoes for no charge 3 finish your meal with the baklava coupe this comes with 3 types of ice cream i remember it comes with pistachio ice cream and it comes with pieces of baklava so delicious even if you feel full once you see this your stomach will magically make room pita jungle gets a solid 4 stars from me for a tempe restaurant i would give it an easy 5 stars but with all things considered equal around phoenix ill give it a solid 4
__label__1 i cant say enough good things about this place i literally have never had a plate here i didnt like they also have a interesting and ever changing list of specials i usually order off the specials menu this is definitely one of those places i could eat at every day all that and i dont even drink beer my friends really like the beer here though
__label__1 its the best downstairs hanging at the bar you cant beat it the food is excellent
__label__1 i would give it 5 but i want to try it again to make sure very tasty mole good drinks great atmosphere excellent service
__label__1 this place has great food some of the best bar food around but you really go for the beer its a brewery right i havent tried a beer i didnt like here there should be one that fits your taste even if youre not a big beer drinker the prices are reasonable and even better during happy hour which has two convenient times during the day regular and reverse if youre unfamiliar with the beer choices try a sampler and then grab a pint of your favorite
__label__1 wow that is some great bbq probably the best i have had in arizona the pork was great as were the bbq beans i will be there again and again
__label__1 this is the goto place for me and and a few of my coworkers why because its somewhat healthy one of my coworkers is vegetarian and they have a lot of vegan offerings and we all love the food here not everything is perfect but the meat is always very well cooked and lean they sometimes use too much garlic but i like garlic but the portions are healthy sized and you dont have regret later for eating badly the gyros here are great btw
__label__1 mehnot particularly memorable ive eaten at this location and the one by asu though i like this location better i would probably only eat here if i was walking by and i was starving the cookies rock though i like that you get one with your sandwich and they have my favorite flavor of jones soda sugarfree black cherry which kicked ass warning the roast beef sandwich overture comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother i like the spice but it was almost unbearable my nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall go to opa grill next door instead
__label__1 great date place i was worried that i wouldnt like what they picked for me because i dont like vegetables but the chef worked right around that the cheese plate was very good but the bread that it came with was fantastic the short ribs were great i loved all of my wine pairings as well
__label__1 i have never had a bad meal from here i cant say the service is quite up to par considering the menu interior and pricing but sometimes the food is all you need to be won over this restaurant is within walking distance from my work and when i have gone for lunch i have never had to wait the host is professional and poised unfortunately the hostesses are not as much but again you can quickly look past that the menu has already changed at least a couple of times which makes the dining even more fulfilling because you can keep trying new things the food is definitely not average or casual cafe style yet you can find things on the menu such as homemade chips baked macaroni and cheese and a buffalo sloppy joe the bar is beautiful and they have live jazz on saturday nightsgreat for a business lunch a romantic dinner or tasteful happy hour
__label__1 a definite four stars the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in scottsdale civic center now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit veg and the nectar of the gods coffee all packed into one nice bright orange place old town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find can i say i hope to see this as a scottsdale yelp hidden gem as for my last meal i had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations the fresh basil really added the extra taste service was ok a typical cafe style the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go so many little restaurants like this keeps me looking for the next one dont forget for later in the night az 88 is just down a few steps happy breakfast kevin ps there seems to be some kind of yelp trend does a hand full of yelps make a difference in a restaurant does that have a yelp definition when this happens
__label__1 fun place to get masks for all my robberies i joke but really you can get good masks at easleys
__label__1 mmmm this is a tasty burger jules pulp fiction i like this place my siblings like this place and its the best thing ive got to remembering better times back home in california its a quick fix for people who want good burgers at a decent price it always hits the spot when im feeling like a fatty even considered biking all the way here from my house when my car was dead and going through the drive through coz the cool kids did it back then in ca anyway haha and employees didnt care i agree that drive thru is an atrociously long wait during the afternoon after school peeps who work here seem pretty chill since i always always ask them for the hats and throw dozens and dozens of ketchup packets in with my togo orders biiiiiiiiiiig plus
__label__1 these little sliders are tasty delicious and pretty speedy you get two and you can get them with or without grilled onions there is a home made type thousand island dressing on them that adds so much to these wonderous burgers fries are 5 star as wellalso enjoy the people watchingscottsdale at its finest
__label__0 people used to rave about this place i never got itand i find it interesting that several other folks said the same thing in their reviews the parking lot would be full if you didnt get here before 7 pm the service was always terrible and the crowd was overwhelmingly hipster morons yeah sure thats better than the popped collar frat boy meat heads on mill ave but not who i want to spend my time with this place is for folks with too much to prove im pretty sure i only went once maybe twicei wont be back
__label__1 first timers to this park on an early sunday morning me my bf and our 2 old english bulldogs had a great experience you can choose between the active or passive dog park we choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all we were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers very friendly we walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way we did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm no foul looking forward to bringing the dogs here again
__label__1 tried a little if everything the bars are worth the drive across town unbelievably good the bars have a moist short bread crust it is absolutely addictive the strawberry cupcake was perfection cookies were very good but the bars and cup cakes stole the show thank heavens it is not closer to home
__label__0 ha hahahahaha pit is right man this place would have been a terrible idea if i wasnt already expecting lameness now occupying the space that has seen the death of not one but two dance club 411 and level peach pit afterdark i mean cherry lounge and pit is beyond ghetto opened by the same people who do sugar daddys and dos gringos this place has all the sexiness and allure of a trails commercial you know i was half expecting to turn a corner to see a neon colored bikiniclad bleached blonde on top of a motor boat well theyve updated the look of the cagetrapped gogo dancers to mini panties with kneehigh dragon rider boots with fuzzy muppet skins adorning them the vids of drunken loungegoers a la daddys and now dos playing in tiny screens on the walls in hallways and behind bars in tact interspersed with footage of seriously hagard looking chics doing sexy things like sucking on lollipops cherries winking yes she was winking right at you wasnt she inviting you in to her reddrenched lair to bask in the glow of a alcohol doused club circa 1992 im not sure what the dress code we were so violently and largely reminded of in line but the girl in front of me had on an oversized tshirt baggy jeans and flip flops and they took her 5 and let her in no problem i also saw a girl dressed exactly like peggy bundyno joke spandex black calf leggings long spandwex shirt in orange heels and a giant boob belt it was so incredible i took a picture she was not impressed with my observation so i had to sneak the photo anyway take it for what it is a club owned by dos gringos guys on mill ave
__label__0 the service was very slow people at several tables were waiting far to long for drinks checks food the table had no bread plate no salt and pepper no napkins we had to ask for everything the busser did not seem to understand how to set a table we ordered the beet salad it had no flavor and huge hard as a rock beets no cheese tiny orange wedges no good i ordered for a main dish the covina white fish it was so salty i had to send it back the waitress then informed me that i ordered it wrong last time i checked you made sure your food tasted good and wasnt toxic with salt she informed me that it was served blackened blackened does not mean coated in disgusting salt my hubby ordered capellini the shrimp were undercooked and not fresh there was very little tomato sauce it was bland greasy and void of any redeeming qualities again like the beet salad the veggies were not prepared correctly huge lumps of tomatoes mix yourself how do you serve pasta with no sauce overall i would say the chef is not talented no one bothers to prep properly no one is tasting the plates as they are so bad it is impossible to believe the menu is being checked and corrected in the meantime to go back for a glass of wine and an appetizer may happen as there is some potential just a glimmer and in a few months if enough people review and finally if the owner is smart enough to stop this unfortunate cascade the patio is pleasant i hope someone cares enough
__label__1 heather is awesome she did my initial set of lashes and ive already gone back for a fill her prices are great and she does beautiful work the compliments are rolling in absolutely recommend
__label__1 my first visit to sweet republic and when i was done my first thought was why did i take so long to come here i sampled a few of their ice creams and let me tell you all delicious in particular the mint chip ice cream was delicious it tastes like fresh mint because get this it is service was quick and friendly we got in right before a rush and let me tell you the staff were able to handle it like pros each of their ice creams are homemade and you can just taste the love mixed into each one you can tell how proud they are of their creations i wont go into the kinds of ice cream they have but can tell you that whatever you choose you will love stop on down took me 30 minutes to get there from gilbert and enjoy a cone or cup do yourself a favor and dont delay for 3 years like i did
__label__1 i really dig this place but i have to say every 3rd or 4th visit to this restraunt is a miss not sure why but it is most of the time spot on i love the pho but the noodle dishes are what is off either way the owners are super sweet and nice and it usually is never too busy service is good carry out is great as well just be careful in the noodle dish category becuase if your really hungry in my experience it may miss the mark order pho to be safe
__label__1 oh my gooooooooodness i love this store i have been a tea enthusiast ever since i received a cast iron tea pot for christmas a few weeks ago i purchased a groupon for 20 worth of merchandise for 10 and headed over to the store the experience was amazing the varieties were intriguing the prices were reasonable and the owner was very knowledgeable and friendly also the layout of the store was appealing and inviting when we visited the store we received a packet of tea for the stores 1st birthday i hope there will be many more to come
__label__1 i walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer for free it was a delicious ipa and the staff couldnt have been friendlier there were even snacks i also had another sample of their camelback ale both were heaping samples almost a full cup the tour was fun and informative the co owner george even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop we didnt bring our bikes so awesome definitely recommend lovely way to spend a saturday afternoon
__label__1 sometimes you just gotta have a burger i was in the scottsdale rdgrayhawk area and noticed this place where nicks used to be i tasted their burger at the scottsdale culinary festivals burger battle and thought it was really good the cbcb burger with tater tots really hit the spot for lunch the burger and carmelized onions worked together really well the tater tots were delicious overall it was a satisfying meal and ill be back soon
__label__1 ive always had consistent quality of food and service here standard menueverything is a la carte ive been to this specific location about half a dozen times i recommend city hall or mastros n scottsdale over mortons but between flemings and here its a tossup i would eat at eitherbut i would probably choose flemings over mortons
__label__0 if only i where rating this place based on their sushi i would give it 5 stars but im not rating it based on the food it is purely based on the customer service in this establishment be warned if you have a large party this is not the place to go ive been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and i have never heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties so for an over 50000 bill they will take 15 different forms of payment but wont split up the check by individuals or couples how does this make any sense to make matters worse they bring out the sushi and i quote family style since when did sushi get served family style here is the problem sushi is expensive not everyone at the table ate it and when served family style someone else may get what you ordered and you wont have a clue it even made it to the table we spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill seriously when i asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was this is our company policy we do not split checks for large parties this is absurd so not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill im pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill how could you know with that many people ordering i never received part of what i ordered yet it made it on that bill so here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received i understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which i dont normally have a problem with but how about some excellent customer service in return if policy is no separate checks at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur they said someone was told when the reservation was made the reservation was made for 25 people it wouldve taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information worst experience ever
__label__1 i have been coming to this bar for over 4years now and i will continue to do so just be aware that this is no longer j chew company originally when it was called j chew i fell in love with the place it had a cool underground loungy charm it was the best place to meet new and interesting folks now it is known as old town tavern and has more of a generic sports pub theme that is dominated by tvs the crowd is slightly older and the bartenders arent as wildfun not a great place to take a date any more on the upside the place is much cleaner now has live music almost every night and tuesday movienight has some serious potential check it out for yourself
__label__1 we went to milagro grill for the 2nd time and it was delicious again the ambiance and patio are very nice the service is fast and friendly and the food is fantastic this time we had the chips and guac and pbj appetizer wow both are wonderful we also had the chicken and chorizo mac n cheesefantastic and filling last time we had tacos with pineapple which was also wonderful cant believe the place isnt packed every night we live in the area and will go back soon you should too
__label__1 this is one of my favorite places to eat when i get back to town their beans are the best ive had their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside this makes the best product all of you lucky enough to live in the state dont realize how lucky you are to have this treat im usually not an enchilada fan but you have to try one here some of the reviews comment on decor while it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles i would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china and that salsa i really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles but then id have to check it in my bag to go back home
__label__1 as i revealed in a previous review my family loves innsuites this location is nestled in the squaw peak mountain preserve close to the prestigious biltmore area and offers easy access to downtown phoenix scottsdale and the camelback corporate corridor innsuites offers comfotable clean rooms for a very rasonable price and as with all of the innsuites locations the northern location includes amenities such as free social hour and free hot breakfast with eggs potatoes waffles toast cereal yogurt fruit coffee milk juices there isnt really much within walking distance at this location so either plan to hang around the pool a lot or youll need to have a car
__label__1 love five guys
__label__1 more a comment than a review suffice it to say i love this store much to my surprise and delight they are opening a second store at 75th and cactus right in my own backyard dont ya know woo hoo now all we need for the nw valley is lees sandwiches and a solid dim sum joint to complete my favorite asian trifecta
__label__1 treated my sisterinlaw to a message here on super bowl sunday they have great hours were very accommodating even though we only made our appts about 24 hours in advance when we booked the receptionist who was really helpful and nice mentioned the groupon promotion 40 for 100 worth of services as well as spafinder gift cards we thought we could combine them and we arrived at our appt to find that they werent supposed to combine discounts but the receptionist made an exception and we were really appreciative the massage was nice could have used a little more pressure cute atmosphere and friendlyhelpful staff i would come back especially with spafinderdiscounts
__label__0 i shouldnt have judged this place so soon they are local to my apartment they do deliver for 290 but ive been back 3 times since my first review and im getting bummed out here a few weeks back my boyfriend and i wanted to get a little buzzed at home so we decided on streets of new york to deliver us some grub we went with pasta my boyfriend got the spaghetti with meat balls and i got the meat ravioli ah i really hate to say this but i would have had a better time eating a can of chef boyardee i dont know what is up with their beefsausage but it always has a funny taste to it kind of like when you reheat a hamburger in the microwave that taste i was less than impressed the salad it came with was decent and id go back just for the bread but even with a buzz i wasnt enjoying my pasta the boyfriend agreed it lacked flavor and was off then yesterday we decided to have another one of these nights and do the pizza instead since our pizza was good the first round i got chicken and pepperoni on mine and he got sausage they charge extra for chicken um i dont really understand why the chicken is breaded chicken strips that they just cut up and threw on the pizza i wasnt impressed at all the sausage on my boyfriends pizza tasted weird and sweet like i dont know whats up with this place so i say if youre going to go with one of their pizzas definitely get a coupon and stick to the basics i suggest the bacon or pepperoni
__label__1 if you are looking for a serious pool experience look no further than this hotel you stay at this hotel for the pool and maybe the surrounding restaurants like ricos but especially for the pool this pool includes a lazy river super slide pool volleyball miniature golf yes mini golf a western village at least three pools and plenty of hours of familyfun in the sun oh and adult kids are more than welcome too this hotel provides the ultimate poolside experience so if thats what you are looking for this is your spot you wont find so scottsdale peeps with their stilettos and muscles popping out of their ed hardy you will find downtoearth people and families wanting to have a good time without worrying about what they look like in a bathing suit the squaw peak property itself is pretty awesome too i really think you could stay here and have a weekends worth of activities without leaving the property squaw peak mtn is just a hop away and perfect for a morning hike ive already professed my love to the pool above they have plenty of restaurants on property including ricos american grill which is delicious and holeinthewall which is fun oldwestern fun they have a gift shop full of fun memorable items they have a creamery a general store with breakfast and snack essentials and lets not forget about the multiple tennis courts as i said this is a resort this is an old school az resort its not frilly but its fun and i think id take fun or frilly when it includes a pool like this ps summer rates are incredible and start at only 89 a night its worth it for a staycation or if youre in town for the weekend
__label__1 awesome donuts the only thing is i was expecting the light fluffy glazed that krispy kreme has this is not the same however these donuts are homemade delicious and why not support small businesses so why the 45 star instead of 55 well the majority of our group loved the donuts and swears by them however one or two just thought they were alright and preferred a light airy donut a la krispy kreme lameeee so thats why i am trying to represent all opinions here in my reviews we were headed there when they were closing the dining room apparently the drive thru is 24 hours though but the nice lady allowed us to come inside we had a rather large group with us the buttermilk donut is amazing totally worth the late night trip these donuts taste fresh delicious and the customer service was so great when we were there that night this place is the best donut place i have been to in az no more kkreme or ddonuts that place is not that good anyway just go to bosa and you will never go to a chain donut shop again
__label__1 i am not a big beer drinker so i cant attest to the many different options they have in that area but i can tell you about their martinis they have a huge menu of specialty martinis and other cocktails that are all pretty darn tasty if you ask me my friend really liked the chocolate something or other martini i had a pear one that was delicious and another pal really enjoyed the pomegranate press the food is pretty good or i was buzzed or both we had the cheese pizza and an onion ring tower both halfoff for happy hour which by the way truly is a tower of onion rings and then the waitress brought out a free piece of cheesecake for my birthday it was a great time had by all but the best thing about yard house is the location its right by kona and z tejas and if you start right at 3pm you can hit happy hour at each location and then take the free trolley to giligins yes i did this on friday and it was tons of fun try it
__label__1 probably go to this location or the one at arrowhead once a month very much a fan and rarely disappointed with each visit they usually have coupons online and they take them from your smartphone the only gripe i have is that their bananas at breakfast are usually still a little too green to be tasty although the donut muffins make up for it recommended for all meals but lunch and dinner are usually a little better screw flanders
__label__1 i am a big fan of chicken and waffles and i will try it just about anywhere it is served i especially love it in the morning when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast expect me to go for the fried chicken lolos was just alright for me i liked the chicken but i was not fond of the waffles they were a little too thin light i dunno how to describe it but i like my chicken and my waffles to have a little crunch and there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles i cant put my finger on the flavor i liked the atmosphere okay but i probably wont be back i know mrs whites golden rule cafe is not for everyone but honestly i prefer the feel there it feels less affected by its customers i guess for some reason i am finding it hard to come up with the words here but lo los feels like it is the more popular cousin of mrs whites you know the one with the letter in football anyway i am glad lolos is thriving maybe i will try the scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things
__label__1 i dropped off a ton of things here when i was liquidating my life in this town and it was a terrific experience their donation program is quick and easy just drive around to the back of the store and put it in a bin and really helps out people by selling things at affordable prices and the profits go to provide assistance to the community such great people at this location especially
__label__1 very excited to try this place out i tried the sampler of all 4 beers and really enjoyed them all however the watermelon ale was my favorite great service cool relaxed atmosphere and delicious beer a winner
__label__1 service at this location is superb and worth the wait when they are busy price and selection are awesome too
__label__1 we just completed our third tour with taste it tours and weve been impressed with all of them all 3 tours are distinct and are loaded with excellent restaurants ive spent quite a bit of time downtown but it can be daunting and i havent ventured much to explore and try new things the tours take you to the places you may not notice as you whiz by give the history yes phoenix has history and overall just slow you down to take in the sights sounds and of course food cant decide which tour to take start with the original then the warehouse and finally the evening really theyre all good tips have a light snack before starting the tour yes you do get a lot of food but keep in mind that the tours start at 2pm or 6pm you have introductions overview some history and then a short walk to the first restaurant if youre skipping lunch you might be very hungry when you arrive as the first restaurant 2 wear comfortable shoes you will be walking about 2 miles nothing strenuous or fast paced but just be conformable also wear comfortable clothing as you will get full 3 pace yourself dont eat everything that is in front of you each restaurant gives a fair amount of food now multiply that by 3 more restaurants that remain on the touryou get the idea you will be full highly recommend for anyone locals out of town visitors guests of locals team building etc really who doesnt like food side note taste it tours was founded by a few phoenix locals who love food and their city they have only been around about a year now and have been doing extremely well they base their business around supporting local businesses local supporting local im excited to see how well theyve done and wish them all the best more tours are in the works and i will definitely be taking them
__label__1 grab a cup grab an outdoor chair enjoy the show
__label__1 the price and pho was awesome the waiter was great with helping me figure out what to get tried 11 loved the beef tendon and tender meat but not a fan of the meatballs there was a tiny bone in mine i am a spoiled nyc bahn mi eater so the bahn mi wasnt my favorite i thought the meat was too fatty but the boyfriend liked the bbq pork bahn mi i also love the do it yourself take home containers homemade hot sauce and i even heard they will refill your broth bring an appetite even with the normal size i was stuffed
__label__1 my son and i were in town and went by pizzeria bianco and didnt want to wait 2 hours so while on the way back to the hotel my son used yelp and found this little gem the pizza was pretty good and i had a pasta special that was quite good the owner was very attentive the nearby table had ordered a large pizza and they were served a slab that was 1 x 3 on a wooden plank very impressive the only negative is that the guy cooking the pizzas should let them get a little browner maybe even a little char to make the taste more authentic
__label__1 went here for lunch on a weekday and thought itd be busier the slower setting allowed for more personal attention though the chef even came out to talk to us and gave us free samples of some of the desserts the food was good but didnt blow me away i think its a nice option for a snazzier its a little pricey lunch with friends
__label__1 i went during the week with my two young children we met a friend who also has a young child nice use of space we didnt watch television but it does have a few flat panel tvs that would be nice during football season on a weekend the space was child friendly nice menu although they didnt offer crayons to kids which they said they were in the process of incorporating menu was huge and offered lots of traditional breakfast combinations i had the waffle with eggs and sausage i ordered the pigs in a blanket for my children it is prepared with sausage that was fantastic the perfect amount of spice and wrapped in pancakes that were also really good my waffle was wonderful really light and fluffy but with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside my friend ordered the french toast which was coated in captain crunch cereal this sounds odd but it was incredibly good and the bacon served with it balanced out the sweetness and served with her choice of bacon she ordered the applewood smoked bacon it was excellent they have five different types of bacon including one infused with jalapeno which i will try next time the service was a bit slow but understandable given it was the first week of opening the staff was very friendly and attentive i will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone for a nice neighborhood breakfast spot
__label__1 its a walmart with a subway inside
__label__1 what a brewpub should be the beers are great the food the slingers wow the service is all top rate lisa the server was very helpfull i need say no more
__label__0 nah i forked over 13 for a club sandwich mac n cheese and a large pepsi the mac n cheese was good and the sandwich was just okay i say take your 13 and go to texaz grill way better food and for 13 you can get dessert too
__label__1 average cajun food nothing special i came here late on a tuesday night few people there its a dive of a place in a strip mall a bluesman was playing nice quiet blues on an electric guitarvery nice kinda scruffy place with all the basic cajun staples nothing fancy decent brews i think the bar tender was waiting tables i probably wont be back but i had heard it was great and wanted to try it i think i like more upscale digs and fancierpricier fare
__label__1 okay if youre looking for a genuine chicago vienna beef red hot or a ny sabrett street cart dog then you might not understand hot dog stop hds does sever sabretts but this is more of a gourmet hot dog place the portions are very generous to say the least and very tasty the folks who run the place are from france and have put their own spin on things so if youre fixed on what a hot dog should be then go to lukes or als or even a w but if you want something completely different to borrow a phrase then by all means try hds enjoy
__label__1 great coffee shop with tasty lunch and dinner options very good coffee and cozy atmosphere a couple of critiques i found the lunch and dinner menu a bit overpriced for what i received i frequently stop in early in the mornings for coffee and a muffin i live in the area the muffins are excellent unique and tasty when they are available it doesnt seem like the pastry chef begins early enough in the morning to have pastries ready to go around 630 or 7am most other niche coffee shops ive been to in the phoenix area have fresh baked goods ready to go early in the am for early commuters like myself
__label__1 love this place great selection of beers cheap 3 per beer happy hour relaxed atmosphere and walking distance to the light rail some nights they have live music which isnt always to my taste but i like that they provide a venue for local artists and musicians on top of everything else on first fridays its packed so good or bad depending on your feeling about crowds i avoid it those nights but on other nights its just a very cool and comfortable place to hang out sometimes parking is kind of hard to find
__label__1 where do i begin i love casey moores what a great ambiance the outside patio is where its at with tons of seating and misters lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while youre waiting for friends to arrive and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly when i feel like getting in touch with my hippie side i go to casey moores because i can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art or photographing the wandering cats yes they have cats theyre wellfed and happy it gets pretty busy after 5pm but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night i bring my dog in all the time and she is always met with animal lovers who didnt know they could bring their pets so now you know the oysters are good but if youre eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you i had never tried oysters before going to caseys but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses if youre feeling pretty ballsy go pee on the blarney stone every time i go there i wish i was a man so i could do it
__label__1 loved my visit here i was talked into the meatloaf for dinner i have never ordered meatloaf at a restaurant but tonight i did the combination of meatloaf and a bit of mashed potatoes and gravy on my forkheaven i was sure to chew in every corner of my mouthmy taste buds were going crazy
__label__1 fajitas is one of those places where you may go for an occasional unmemorable lunch nothing is gross nothing is exceptional everything is just well there ive tried different variations of the fajitas theme over several lunches chicken steak veggie etc and they were all ok not a big fan of their tortillas though if you work anywhere near there then id say go ahead its a safe bet for lunch you wont puke or curse the world but is it a joint where im saying dude you gotta try this place out nah youve had better fajitas elsewhere 3 stars
__label__1 lets see great coffeegreat muffinsgood servicecoffee drinks need some work though dd never lets me down when it comes to plain ole american coffeebut there attempts at making coffee drinks to compete with starbucks and even mcdonalds for that matter come up lame i tried for example the frozen hot chocolate the other daytaste like plain ole chocolate milk with whip cream the coolattas and other frozen drinks are not bad but starbucks is much better however with all that being saidno one makes a better cup of coffee by fast food standards anyway than does dd the coupons i get every couple of weeks also rock because i can get that great coffee cake muffin they make for 99 cents i also get get coupons for 100 off combosfree doughnutsand even 99 cent for large coffees although i never have that sizelol so if your looking for great coffee and maybe a cheap breakfast to go along with it give dd a try and remember to eat drink and be merry my friends
__label__1 what can i saymaharaja palace was my midday getaway while living out in phoenix and i miss it dearly i visit as often as i can up to three times a year traveling from hawaii and when i do i am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides the tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and i find the staff to be accomodating and attentive especially when ensuring ive got enough naan to sop up my plates delightful curries i cant wait to return this is the spot for indian food in the phx metro area hands down
__label__1 im probably at tmi too often everybody is so nice though and the beer is so good i have to admit i really dont eat anything here but the appetizers and i rarely stray from drinking a pint or two of humboldt brown so yes i am predictable and limited despite my limitations however i love this place its my cheers i am its norm what rocks best happy hour around seriously 250 for some of the best brews in town although the hempseed infused humboldt is my goto brew ive tried the raspberry ale refreshing without being cloying and the yummy inebriator stout which believe me will knock your socks off good vibes hip decor comfortable without being pretentious how can i not return on a regular basis
__label__1 i am not in love with this place nor do i despise it i am mr middleofthe road with stacys somethings he does very well others are just soso here are the dos and donts doorder a sweet potato pie to go that happens to rock the house have the pulled pork sandwich solid sandwich dontdo not and i mean do not order the chicken bbq sandwich i ordered this a couple months ago and i could have used the shredded chicken as toothpicks they were hard and came served in a weird conelike shape on the bun also skip the sweet potato fries they are dry and taste like dirt yep i said it sorry stacy back to the drawing board on those the sauce is everything at a bbq joint and his is just ok actually i have had better in a storebought bottle from ajs if you are in the area go for it if you live out in glendale its probably not worth the drive i am not sure what bon appetite was thinking when they gave this one of the top 10 new bbq joints of 2009 the lady who works behind the counter is funny as hell and is a total sweetheart btwcash money only
__label__0 if i could give zero stars i would just about the worst experience for my friend and i we came in for a quick and easy dinner after being ignored at the door way repeatedly we sat ourselves first we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving i have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone theyre lazy slow and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there the happy hour prices are great but there are other ras so do yourself a favor and go to a different location
__label__1 excellent food and service
__label__1 amanda was very helpful when we looking at the ferrits a great pet store

__label__1 i cant speak to the selection hours owners or resident cat i can tell you that we noticed an honor system as we walked by tonight with our mojo an honor system in this day and age yes please friend and i both picked a 1 paperback shoved our bills under the door and walked away feeling like winners a silent invisible transaction between fellow bibliophilesabsolutely lovely
__label__1 i was given a 100 gift card to use at willow stream spa last december ive been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then well guess what today was that day with my fiance out of town for the weekend i took advantage of some much deserved gabi time as i like to call my downtime i called a few days ago to make an appointment and i asked if there were any specials going on lucky for me there were several the one that was most appealing to me was the book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it i chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it i was in heaven ill back up a moment and just say that ive been to the willow stream spa before years ago today was even more heavenly than i remembered i checked in around noon and didnt leave until after 6pm i couldve stayed longer but i had to come home to take minnie out the willow stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine i started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial i had tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck back and shoulders ive been having shoulder pain so i think she customized this based on my situation she was fantastic but with just 30 minutes it felt like a tease my facial made it all worthwhile though it was pure bliss heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job i highly recommend her she explained every product she was using as i fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders chest neck scalp hands and feet the products felt amazing and smelled good too so much so that i bought a couple on my way out after my services i had lunch a delicious salad with veggies and chicken while i wrote some thank you notes and read my book it was so peaceful it was like an escape from the world and i enjoyed every second of it so bottom line if you are thinking about getting a spalover like me a gift anytime soon willow stream spa giftcards are always welcome what an experience im feeling energized relaxed and peaceful
__label__1 i love trader joes i think theyre selection of products are just great i cant get enough of it the place is clean and the people are friendly its right next to michaels which is also great its in a convenient place it seems like the people there are nuttycrunchy which i love
__label__1 went back to true foods i have been doing this a lot since my first trip with my mom for dinner last week it was amazing as always however this time was different i tried a new menu item the bison burger i highly reccomend this it was so tastey and very light for a burger omg i want to say that this time was different because we had the best service ever our server marcus was amazing he was very informative helpful polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some love this cat just thought i would give credit where it is due too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives i work in a restaurant and know its important for employers to know who their stars are marcus is your star a bright and shiney star lol loves shitaki mushroom lettuce cups ahi sliders spaghetti squash kale salad raviolli green tea coffe black and i always have to have the banana chocolate tart definitely
__label__1 httpstevelerercom i traveled to phoenix only a few days away from the la marathon in march and was determined to start carbo loading early my first stop was matts big breakfast a place i had patroned back in 2010 that time i ordered the item that guy tried on triple d and it was really good he ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs it was delicious with a great pesto topping i only wished i could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if i had asked the restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person i didnt mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before i was able to sit at the bar the decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming the staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon crispy hashbrowns and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast the eggs were right under medium which is where i like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside somewhat like a potato latke just without all the onion by far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isnt and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked matts got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much just where i like it i could have eaten platefuls of this stuff if only they were in la at the end of the marathon the last thing in my order was the real reason i returned to matts each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options bread aside the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side the jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant it is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside it has so much flavor in such a simple concoction i could eat a jar of it too bad they only give you about two ounces i wonder if they bottle and sell it because i would buy all in all matts big breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown phoenix no wonder it always has a wait the peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but in the end i would come here every time i visit phoenix just for the strawberry jam check out matts big breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think overall review 710
__label__1 so happy that drybar opened a central phoenix location fun atmosphere great customer service and high quality blowoutspretty much an exact replica of the north scottsdale location but at a much more convenient location for me took my sisterinlaw here for a birthday treat we were greeted by a friendly hostess and they accommodated our request to sit next to each other as we enjoyed our blowouts and mimosas great idea and great brand will definitely be back again for a special occasion do
__label__0 i am one of those people that talk crap about gordon biersch behind its back but im nice to its face i go there and continue having expensive yet mediocre meals but like i just said i go there my boyfriend asked me once why do it to yourself when you dont enjoy it i dont know maybe im a masochistic eater actually im just very agreeable and i work super closeby and if i didnt go there i would just walk over to whole foods and spend a zillion dollars on a goulashy takeout container that i dont even like after i pay for it for me lunch is more about getting out and doing something else for an hour a day if someone wants to go to gb i will happily tag along and probably eat even though i know i wont like it at least theres not much harm in that except to my wallett ps lori is the nicest sweetest serverbartender ever and chatting with her makes up for the crappy food
__label__1 went here because of the reviews on yelp very good had the green papaya salad great light taste and a very large portion with a few shrimp on top had two types of curries and both of them were very tasty i need more of that green papaya salad so ill go back and try a few different things
__label__1 ok ill say this up front i dont like chains there are just far too many awesome restaurants in phoenixscottsdale to go to a chain that being said this place is amazing and the quality and consistency here is unreal yes it seems expensive but once youve eaten here youll realize that you are absolutely getting your moneys worth so much awesome unlimited red meat dont let them trick you with the salad bar its killer but dont fill up and dont be ashamed to leave your flipper thing on green the sign of meat greed hahahahaha lastly try the tres leches and the key lime pie out of this world
__label__1 if this place only served chips and their salsa bar i would still give it 5 stars as a salsa and hot sauce theyre different people fanatic i tend to judge mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa and la condesa ranks high last time i was there i counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments limes onions etc they offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa to spicy chipotle or creamy cilantro it looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table but you have to try them all the horchata here is also 5star material dont be a cheapskate shell out the 4 for it its giant it will make you happy and when youre done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts the drink keeps on giving i have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious i must say i am not a huge fan of their rice and beans which seem a bit bland to me but the tacos salsa and drinks all make up for some plain ol rice i was very happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that la condesa is applying for a liquor license this place needs to stick around for awhile
__label__1 just a quick review to get the ball rolling popped in here on opening night and was pleasantly surprised hubby and i split the mussaman a hearty portion of curried veggies and shortribs and the garlic veggies with tofu the mussaman was by far the star and given its 16 entree price it needed to be i see a lot of promise here though i do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood i should hope once they get their liquor license expected sometime in january according to the waitress that the food prices will come down im not holding my breath on this one however since the moniker modern thai has become euphemism for expensive thai i look forward to trying sabai again after theyve had some time to coalesce
__label__1 fecking great update went for lunch this time i thought the corned beef taquitos even better than last curry chips tad saltier still loving the appetizers and the cider this time had the cottage pie its really nothing to write home about specially if you are from the region and your parents wouldnt appreciate you seeing other cottage pies spend the extra on the sheperds its really much better this was ok really really nothing special and the heat could have been better service is good but pedestrian the last time i had no time pressure this time i did were sitting at 35 375 now with the round up till 4 still ill return original review first thanks to julie p for pointing out that this place exists that its within stumbling distance of the house think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour versus a quick trip and recover is even better cider on tap is strongbow and you get it in a real pint yay sadly thats all they have and theres no bottled ones to try strongbow is the bud of uk ciders and while its way better than no cider or what passes for beer here its not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar onto the food ill get to it as a venue some other time appetizers curry and chips was exactly what it should have been and a generation of irish and uk kids have grown up with this for lunch at the local chip shop the corned beef and cabbage taquitos i think are moving up to be our 1 appetizer thats not a hot wing taste of these and the hot mustart tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely not heavy on the fat and delightfully crunchy for once an irish restaurant trying to do something other than name us staples with cute regional names main salad and the sheperds pie lets not get into the salad its a waste of time reviewing vegetables the pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other not sure the champ mashed potatos atop them live up to what lies below but its more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish bread and butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal dont just eat it and run round the block four times before getting back in the car oddity parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green please just buy green speckled plates its classierd at the end got a coupon for 25 off the next bill which i will certainly take them up on its as good for food as any of the valleys irish bars better imho but have to get back on pub quiz night to really know were in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa the space and know its going to sound bad place looks like standing wave city with anything electric and full drum set the jukebox played im too sexy by right said fred wtf that really messed up the ambiencecountry bars dont have nin on the box after all
__label__0 meh ive experienced better pretty much sums up my experience here tonight i have a sneaking suspicion that this is the goto sushi place for people who either a dont know anything about good sushi or b have no taste buds and money burning a hole in their pocket i didnt really know what to expect from this place before we arrived id never heard of it before and the only reason we agreed to go was because it was close to my boyfriends house and our friend said it was pretty reasonable in price and quality of food my boyfriend and i arrived before our friends and we walked to in an almost completely deserted restaurant there was some really bad techno remixes of popular songs playing in the background and an episode of dr phil on the television i sat down in one of their ridiculously tall bar chairs while my boyfriend went to grab us a menu we could look over while waiting for our friends to arrive most uncomfortable chairs ever i couldnt have been sitting in it longer than a couple of mins before i had to get up out of it the seat had an aluminum bar or something all the way around it that dug into my leg after sitting down its hard to describe how or why they were so uncomfortable but if youve been here before you know what i mean they clearly chose these chairs based on aesthetics alone anyway our friends arrived and we all ordered our food i decided on getting the ultimate salmon roll and i believe it was called the sun roll i could be wrong on the name of that second one but it was something close to that my boyfriend got a couple rolls and we decided to share a plate of tuna sashimi for the 2 rolls i ordered and the plate of sashimi it was almost 40 my boyfriend got the sunshine roll and a las vegas roll those two rolls plus a drink was more than 20 so all together we spent more than 60 i love sushi i would be more than happy to pay those prices for a plate of delicious fish but what came out was not what i was expecting for the price we paid my rolls were pretty but they were almost inedible i pretty much choked down the ultimate sushi roll 2 or 3 pieces into eating it i debated wether or not it was worth finishing the little tiny bit of smoked salmon that was inside was dry and i could barely taste the fresh salmon that was conservatively layered on top i moved onto the whateversun roll and that was a little bit better but it was still lacking in flavor and texture the sashimi was just awful it didnt taste like fish it almost didnt taste like anything and the texture of it was really weird it was almost chewy my boyfriend and i have been known to just down entire plates of sashimi in less than a min or two but after one piece he called it quits and it took me the entire rest of our time in the restaurant to finish the plate the staff was pretty nice i mean they werent going out of their way to be pleasant with us but they werent rude either all together id say this visit and the food was a total failure i feel like this places only saving grace is that its clean and its in a pretty convenient location i would have liked to give this place another shot and try another couple of rolls before writing my review but i was really disappointed with the food i am having a hard time even using that word because it was barely edible i ordered it wasnt the worst sushi in the world but it wasnt anywhere near the best and with the prices theyre charging for these lackluster rolls i really dont see myself ever coming back here again
__label__1 the food is good but took a while to get to us
__label__1 this place is our go to mexican place i love the hot sauce and you cant go wrong with the fundido sauce on the burritos i personally enjoy the chicken fajito chimi with fundido sauce it could possibly be the worst thing there to eat and i love it for the healthier days i like the pollo salad the chicken is always great here
__label__1 went for drinks and appetizers to help benefit friends of animal control and care and was not disappointed i am not a big fan of alcoholic beverages but this place made them fantastically got the dr funk while my companions got zombie and hurricane all were very tasty especially the dr funk mmmmmm the appetizers were well portioned i got the sweet potato fries and the others got calamri and other fishy foods that i dont eat no complaints from them so definitely a good sign service was great even though we were doing the special we still received plenty of attention i will be back but this time to try some food
__label__0 they close earlier than most large book retailers 10pm major bummer for those who like to hit up a bookstore late at night instead if the club lol it seems i usually cant find what i want at this particular location its in my area or id probably pass on it altogether this review is location specific i do love bookstores in general
__label__1 i love fe been shopping at the 12th street location since it opened there doors this store works best for me since i live a very busy lifestyle the prepackaged foods fruits and veggies make life easier for me for a small store they have a great variety of things to choose from this is not a one stop shop to find everything however they seem to always have the items that work best for me they dont have as many safeway or frys grocery deals but they have discounted items regulary to choose from there prices are slightly higher then trader joes for the amount of food the store is always neat and clean there is tons of help incase you have guestions you can bag your own or there is someone there to help you
__label__1 wonderful low priced food love the fries love the buffalo hot wings good spicy chicken sandwich good chili cheese fries good variety of burgers fast service i fight the urge to stop in almost daily
__label__1 i cant get enough of the chicken pesto with feta sandwich here this place has a great sandwich for a reasonable price my only complaint is that they literally put mushrooms on everything but if you are a mushroom fan live it up on another not if you like fresh lemonade you must get a glass of it here it goes great with any sandwich if you are in a pasta mood the chicken pesto pasta is excellent
__label__0 not worth the money food was average and the portion was small for the price i paid
__label__1 in spite of being on the corner of 44th and camelback it does a good job of insulating you from the traffic and taking you some place else in this case our dear communist neighbors to the south i like the sampler because it allows you to enjoy the finest island interpretations of pork beef and chicken also no meal is complete without going bananas for the well tostones you gotta hand it to those castro brothers they forcefully preside over a country that has a pretty great national cuisine viva la revolucion
__label__1 good food decent price and a southwestern atmosphere the food is decidedly better than the decor but then again ive never been big on the southwestern look something about antlers above my head while im trying to have a romantic night out with the lady just doesnt cut it for me i like most everyone else recommend the big ass burger you cant go wrong with their side of mac and cheese either and i recommend giving it a go regardless of how much you fill yourself with all their other delicious entrees
__label__1 hob nobs coffee house and gourmet deli is what has emerged from the dust and smoke that once was the willo house one w not two willo house was a phoenix landmark beloved by many for its tremendous coffee wellworn couches and memories of mary mccanns poetry slamsand loathed by others for its unmistakable smoke stench and vocally hungover clientele so like many cenphos i felt saddened when i saw the closed sign hung on willos door earlier this year and ive been watching for this coffee interloper to open its doors ive been hopeful that wed find a new funky midtown establishment to add to phoenixs growing reputation for goodness feeling emboldened and optimistic after voting on november 4th baby oli and i stopped into hob nobs for a morning caffeine treat let me begin by saying holy moley they got the smell of smoke out i thought for sure that the odor of cloves and american spirit would have permanently saturated the buildings core in fact there was not much at all inside to remind me of the willothatwas theyve knocked down walls to widen the space inside and painted in warm hues the place now has what you might call a décor they said goodbye to funky and eclectic and hellohmm pottery barn i ordered an iced chai tea and a chocolate pastry the chai was a chai and the pastry was yummy but not omgeatherethisinstant yummy the sandwich and salad menu looks awesome with sandwiches boasting of roast sirloin and the finest long line caught albacore tuna center cut all white meat they also have some pretty impressive looking handmade chocolates im not going to lie i do miss the old lovingly rundown willo style hob nobs felt a little too scottsdale to me i may be 100 wrong on this but i dont think the owners of hob nobs are phoenicians the man who made my chai had clearly never been toor maybe even heard ofthe original willo and wasnt interested in any jovial chit chat about the old locale they spelled willo house incorrectly on their takeaway menu and the place simply doesnt have that phoenix feel regardless of the scottsdale vibe i will go back to try those sandwiches or maybe to test out their springy couches and fire place while grading essays id love to toss them one more star fingers crossed that theyll relax a bit and make the most of their great location
__label__0 very slow service food is typical for bk
__label__1 this is the old rigatonys on brown rd if youve never been it has a buca di bepoish before buca was cool sort of feel they even serve their house chianti in a small water glass instead of a wine goblet adding to an authentic joisey kind of feel this is traditional italianamerican fare rich and flavorful with big portions the chicken piccata is crackgood its served in what ive come to learn is a sicilian style with a n awesome relish of tomatoes capers and green olives and a side of addictive fett alfredo it never gets old another great authentic dish is their cecca you can get it as a pie pizza that is or over pasta you just have try it its rich refreshing and explosively flavorful all at once the house salad is a variation on a traditional antipasto theme and is a meal and event in and of its self the best thing about mardeneleys is that everything on the menu is good it only gets four stars because it could use a bit more snob appeal and a better beer selection
__label__0 07092008 just went there last week for the first and last time i read the good reviews so i was expecting much more i am a first generation american both my parents were german and came over in their 20s i lived there for a few years have eaten german food all my life and have been to many german restaurants in many different states over the years i really wanted to like this place as there are not many german establishments around here but this place was terrible we were the only people in the place at 2pm and still had horrible service we were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come she would forget things we had asked her for the waitress didnt understand german as in the german menu options so i ordered from the menu using the english translations and she was still confused i had to point at the options yes there really is cucumber salad on the menu the bread was stale the schnitzel was hard there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just disgusting they also gave me fries instead of the usual sides i am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before because that is exactly what it tasted like plus i actually got charged the wrong prices like lunch salad was 350 but showed up on my bill as 500 etc i was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left disappointed waste of time and money i will not return maybe at dinner time things are better but do not even try the lunch yuck oh and the website is outdated wrong prices and discontinued menu items
__label__1 good clean chilis friendly staff although that can be a bad thing since i have to tip them extra because they refill my cup every 5 minutes i have been going a little bit more than usual because of the 2 for 20 deal never had a bad experience here just wish there was more on the 220 deal
__label__1 i have have given it 3 stars but my partner gave it 4 just keep that in mind i had wanted to check this place out from the first time i saw it and when it came up on groupon it was fate my partner is a sandwich lover so it was perfect firstly they didnt have a lot of vegetarian options which i found disppointing im so sick of my only sandwich choices being either tomatobasilmozz or lettucetomatocheeseand thats pretty much what they had here i went with the caprese option warning when they say fire roasted tomatoes they mean whole tomatoes on bread now im ok with a few tomato slices here or there but giant squishy tomatoes looming over a few spare pieces of fresh basil and fresh mozzerella so not appetizing i ate what i could but was not impressed my partner however made her own sandwich with turkey cheese and some veggies and she loved it i agree that the bread was good and i enjoyed the popcorn chips rather than potato the staff was incredibly nice although the service was a bit slow and the seating options were a bit odd and not very accessible for those with disabilities i wouldnt plan on coming here but if we were in the neighborhood id stop by
__label__1 i really like this place and i must say its the best pizza i have had west of chicago the sauce is on the sweet side but i like that its kid friendly so its a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it the lines can be a little long at times but i think its worth the wait
__label__1 patio seating is lovely
__label__0 filthy place bad tasteless food rude waitress yuck
__label__1 heres an update because the buffet is out at lunchtime only now with a regular menu at dinnertime this old place continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the valley after 1 12 years many visits its friendly inexpensive peaceful comfortable even with lots of customers always satisfying this time i started with a delicious bowl of menudo a nice salad several kinds of fresh fruit tasty cole slaw then headed for the mexican hot table had some spanish rice refried beans a beef taquito an excellent beef tamale hand made not some fastfood thing pretending to be a tamale more but saving room for some chinese the tasty treats over at the chinese hot table included terrific big meaty barbecued pork ribs really good crispy sweet sour pork hey iain justright fried rice a steamed veggies dish in fish juice that included such treats as chinese snow peas all cooked just enough so on what a great lunch for 559
__label__1 the naming of asian themed restaurants is in need of a serious makeover i think this is the next frontier for marketing gurus a potential fortune could be made here most restaurants fall into the category of being painfully bland china food vaguely insulting ethnic caricatures mr yings happy china meal or horrific puns pho sure names like these dont inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of their food even though thats not always the case for example china food was actually pretty good so when i saw thai elephant my mind immediately reversed the name which sounds suspiciously close to a parasitic disease elephantiasis plus the fact that its located in a strip mall is a bit of a red flag but a growling stomach can overcome these biases and so i pulled into the lot and was pleasantly surprised this is actually pretty good thai food the inside is a little more ornate than you would have expected theres the whitewashed walls that fits the strip mall theme but the furniture is darker wood with slightly dimmed background lighting a large screen tv was playing the suns game in the back room and a small bar is present in the front part of the restaurant there are a few tables as well as some seats with a mix of wooden booths and chairs still wary i ordered the hot tea thai sweet potatoes and chicken pad thai all of these were above average the thai sweet potatoes were perfectly fried and mixed well with the slightly tangy sauce i may have eaten more than ten times my body weight in chicken pad thai over the years and this was definitely above average although i was just here for dinner i did see that they have a happy hour which runs from 57 pm all in all its a pleasant place that belies its strip mall exterior and is worth a visit for respectable thai food
__label__1 i am not the biggest fan of fast food ever but i really like five guys and this location is superb they have really yummy fries and they give you so many like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers say what yeah they are really greasy but good the burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is the pop machines are radical you can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like the staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go
__label__1 its baja fresh what can i say its clean theyre fast and its a hell of a lot better than mcdonalds i usually call in my lunch order from work and its almost always ready and waiting when i get there to pick it up i do have to say that their pico de gallo is great and i could probably live on just that for the rest of my life i get extra cups of it and eat it all by itself
__label__1 tum nak has so many good reviews and they deserve every one far east mesa cant be the best location for a place like this but they seem to keep customers coming back i definitely do anyway the yellow curry hot is my favorite but ive tried just about everything on their menu and ive never been disappointed the only negative is that the place is super small so as the popularity gains the more i find myself ordering to go
__label__1 been going to don and charlies for years now its kind of a family tradition a sports hangout you may see some players and coaches during the off season as scottsdale is a big place for spring training this delighted my single girlfriends who took every opportunity to flirt the entire time i visited with them the bar is roomy and comfortable with more than ample stools to accommodate my generous tush say hello to shelley who is mi favorito bartender you are welcome to dine at the bar but the dining room is much more comfortable with a great deal of banquette seating which i adore i often have the veal chop or a nice big ny strip twice baked potatoes creamed spinachyou know the routine in the good old boys steakhouse the best part is the house made chopped chicken livers which are simply to die for valet service rounds out the numerous reasons to choose this place over others in the area i almost forgot the comprehensive wine list including wines by the glass a must stop when you are in scottsdale
__label__1 this place is as good as it gets for shooting i became a full member today after also researching shooters world phoenix rod gun and scottsdale gun club where i will also become a member the cost is very reasonable at 85year 110 after adding the initial administrative fee the club is huge 140 acres there is a main range for members and the public then there are multiple other shooting areas for members only you can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility and you can shoot any weapon the only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo im really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend
__label__1 this is the only ben and jerrys that has successfully withheld the recession in az this means that this is the only one left as well its located in a beautiful plaza called el pedregal they have live music on sundays i found out this information from the friendly owner who told about the history of the store since i asked him if their location was really the only one open in all of az the location is very north scottsdale i am not sure how it does for business it is far from commercial areas on my drove over i mostly noticed many well built homes this is the only ben and jerrys left and i strongly encourage those who enjoy this ice cream to go out and support their business
__label__0 it pains me to write a negative review of pj but i just have to i was so excited for the new location to open because my husband and i go to the indian school location any time were down that way and this is way closer to home we were impressed by all the room up there not cramped like the other locations unfortunately the food was not nearly as good both of our meals were not nearly as good as weve had before at the other locations also our service was terrible we asked another server if ours was new but nope shed bee there since it opened a couple months ago she forgot jalapeno our hummus appetizer to their credit they brought it out after our meal and gave it to us for free but it was bland and not that good she charged me for a side of tahini even though it was supposed to come with my veggie burger and she never refilled our drinks overall this was a very disappointing pj experience ill try again one more time but if it doesnt improve i wont be going back to this north valley location
__label__1 my boyfriend and i had heard about the great food and romantic ambiance of coup des tartes so we decided to check it out overall it was fine but we didnt think it lived up to the hype we knew ahead of time that it was byob but decided to forgo bringing alcohol because of the corking fees no biggie we enjoyed the lemonade and minted iced tea they served us we werent hungry enough for appetizers so we just ordered salads and entrees the salads came out quickly and did not disappoint i ordered the springtime salad 10 and absolutely loved it mixed greens with organic apples red onions dried cranberries chevre and candied walnuts with apple cider vinaigrette they put just the right amount of dressing on it so it was coated but not drenched my boyfriend ordered the parmigiano 9 and said it was very good as well it was your basic caesar salad with homemade dressing both salads were surprisingly large and could have satisfied us for dinner if we had ordered appetizers as well then came the entrees well sort of we sat there until we started to wonder if they were out hunting for our food then we thought maybe we should have ordered an appetizer after all to close the gap a little between the salads and the entrees but really why should we have to pay for something we werent hungry for just so they can get their pacing right anyhow the entrees eventually came i ordered the lambshank 24 and my boyfriend ordered the pork 26 the lamb fell right off the bone and i didnt even have to use my knife it came with a side of israeli couscous which i thoroughly enjoyed my only complaint about this dish would be the sauce it was a harissa spiced vegetable ragout with dried fruits for some reason i was expecting something a little thicker i felt like the lambshank was sitting in a soup actually this sauce did taste like a vegetable stew my mom used to make when i was little that i didnt like it was a little bit of a turnoff to me but not their fault i guess how were they to know i ate it anyway because the meat was cooked so well my boyfriends pork tenderloin was also cooked very well it sat atop a bed of risotto and also came with asparagus i tried a bite of it but my dish was so flavorful that it tasted bland in comparison so i cant give it a fair review he said it was excellent and finished every last bite on the plate so ill take his word for it the service wasok it was fine in the beginning but while they were out hunting for our food between the salads and entrees we were completely neglected and left thirsty after we got our entrees it picked up again and was fine until we left the ambiance quaint and pretty yes but quaint does not necessarily equal romantic in my book we were seated in a small table jammed into the corner the size of the table was fine for two people but it was way too close to the table next to us which had a party of four seated at it every time someone got up from it to go to the restroom their backs were right in my face we had a nice view of the patio out the window right next to us that was until another couple was seated right on the other side of the glass my boyfriend felt very uncomfortable for half of our meal because he felt like he couldnt look to his right or else hed be looking straight at the guy sitting inches away from him i was lucky enough to have been seated right next to the wall so i had the view with a little bit of privacy the room could have also benefited from some white noise in the background because we could hear everyones conversations and felt like we couldnt talk at a normal volume without other people hearing there was some very soft music playing in the background but it could have been turned up a notch or two in a nutshell id give the food four stars but the ambiance and service two and a half stars id go there again to give something else on the menu another try but id request a table on the patio to get out of that cramped little house
__label__1 costco travel my husband and i recently returned from a trip to the big island hi that we arranged throught costco travel after shopping around i found that their prices were the best and after one phone call i was able to make all arrangements for airfair condo and car they didnt have arrangements with any bbs on hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate condo was outstanding and a great value we got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the costco in kona and again saved ive shopped at costco for years now becoming a groupie
__label__1 i am not usually a fan of botanical gardens they seem too precious too perfect to be of much interest and lets face it flowers and plants are beautiful things but when you pay to look at them in neat rows something is lost that said desert botanical gardens is an exception to this garden cynic many of these cacti look like they are from another planet like something you would see in a scifi film and say wow its too bad those crazy plants dont exist they sprawl out on the ground weaving and turning every which way or compose huge bizarre formations high off the ground i never knew such bizarre life forms existed or that some cacti look like trees the gardens are full of windy paths where one is also likely to find a family of quail lizards or a jackrabbit or two various species of bird can be seen here as well especially at dusk i especially love watching the birds fly in and out of nests theyve made in the upper arms of cacti this place never grows old its a great introduction to the desert for people from out of town and because the cacti have been collected from around the world a cool botany lesson for us all here
__label__1 this is not a fancy place its address is on scottsdale road but its easier to get to from shea about a block east of scottsdale its split into two sections as you walk in if you head to the left there is a bar with a couple of pool tables i cant really say that ive spent any time in that section we head to the right where there is a central bar with booths along the walls if you are into karoake this is a great place to go the dj has a great voice and many of the usuals do as well of course there are quite a few who dont but thats to be expected weve been here dozens of times and never not had a good time its casual and very reasonably priced the food is way above average for this casual of a bar the shrimp are spiced to perfection and the chili is to die for
__label__1 voodoo chicken was fantastic most of the entree selections were available over rice or pasta they had many gluten free options and they use brown rice and brown pasta i stumbled upon jaspers peak bistro on accident and i am glad i did cajun inspired food cooked well very satisfying and delicious the server was a bit neglectful but we were loving our food so much and the company of friends that we didnt mind so much the neglectful server did recommend the food we ordered and we were very happy with it
__label__0 had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed my 8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest ive ever had service was slow the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived and staff was unapologetic ive had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch overall a miserable experience and i wont be back
__label__1 great place to have a meal with family can be a little on the loud side cause ita always a busy place recomend calling ahead and getting name put on waiting list reservations party of six or more only price range moderate but well worth it
__label__1 i came here for the first time ever on mothers day they were packed the line was out the door and down the path still they managed to get everyone seated and quickly attended to we were a party of 10 our server was so great and i am sorry to say i do not remember her name she had all 10 drinks refilled continuously brought us lemons and cleared the table with amazing speed as well as taking care of a completely full restaurant packed with children that were running under foot the only down part was that they had plastic dishes but with all those people what are your choices i loved the food i had shrimp and fish and vegetables nothing fried the best part for me was the chocolate fondu although there were many different choices you could never say that you did not like what they were serving have seen a million adverts for this place and i am happy that i finally got to go
__label__1 incredibly good calzones friendly service nice courtyard seating
__label__1 for opening night there was a giant wave of people coming through the door the bar was dimmed in red and purple lights the bright new white dining tables were ready to be eaten on all new upscale posh furniture in the bar dining area and patio we were not able to get dinner but well be back
__label__1 went here because of a groupon will probably not go back without one cons overpriced flat out plus like other reviewers have said they run out of a lot of good stuff also i know this is something small but as their menu changes they should update it online had i known the menu would be so different i would have waited for another week to get a meal i would actually want as opposed to settling also we had reservations and had to wait 20 minutes not a huge deal but a personal pet peeve pros the food was good but like i said overpriced since i had a deal i didnt mind as much atmosphere is nice and i loved the extras we got a few small tasting palate cleansers the cotton candy was fab and though the strawberry dessert was not my first choice it was truly delicious and i may go back just for that dish i love the location and the staff was incredibly friendly informative and courteous knock down the prices and id give it at least 4 stars
__label__1 as one of my fave restaurants in scottsdale the herb box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch at dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio other than the ambiance the food is some of the best fresh local food ive tasted a personal favorite is the free range chicken with goat cheese can you say tasty my mouth waters just thinking about it walking in the crew at the herb box is some of the friendliest youll ever meet and the funniest when you go make sure to save room for dessert the cheesecake of the moment is always a win
__label__1 well our initial plan was to go to tuck shop as ive been wanting to try it out unfortunately two ladies got there 1 sec before us and got the last table the waiting area was packed with a group just hangin and they had a 16 ppl reservation for later there had sitting available right away at the bar but im pregnant and my back is killing me so bar stools were out of the question they were very apologetic which i thought was nice considering if wasnt their fault im glad theyre doing well so i asked my husband if he wanted to try district and off we went actually i made a reservation in case something happened and well we ended up there nice and spacious not crowded at all they were part of az restaurant week and we ordered from that menu shrimp sliders i loved them they should have a big version of it duck quesadilla very good as well but im partial to anything with goat cheese we both got the country chicken steak and it was really good mine came 1 med 1 small pieces instead of a big one the med piece was a bit dry and the breading was slightly burnt the smaller one was perfect juicy and crispy the breading flavor was really good slightly spicy the biscuits were awesome more of a cakebread texture light and fluffy and kind of sweet green beans were tasty as well strawberry shortcake whoopie pies with lime basil sorbet i think it was a sorbet it was good but not something ill order again the pie filling was too sweet even the tartness of the sorbet couldnt help it service was prompt no hovering or having to wait for too long and our food came at a perfect pace great dining experience and it made me forget about tuck shop i still want to try it though
__label__0 bleh i have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot since i frequent the other spots on the same corner i had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling postinos or bomberos or well something other than a drivethru i ordered the daily flatbread pizza it was a chicken teriyaki with prosciutto pineapple and red jalapenos the ingredients didnt seem to be of the best quality the chicken was a little gristly sliced breast meat would have been nice and the cheese was unspeakable it was straightfromabag mozzarella which was congealed into a huge mass of grease the pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings that i couldnt even identify the crust it was disintegrating before my eyes the prosciutto was all in one large clump instead of being sprinkled throughout so disappointing my friends caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil i love a good caprese and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients helps balance out each bite you know no such luck with this one our service was fine helpful enough in the beginning but i think once she sensed we werent thrilled with our food she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction the waitress never asked me how my meal was even though i was clearly picking at it and only ate half of it she offered to clear it away not box it so she must have realized i didnt enjoy it i will definitely wait a while for a return visit since it is close and has a great layoutatmosphere i am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that i would like to revisit
__label__1 love this place the food was amazingwho cares if its chain restaurant we had tried to go the night before but they were packd so we made a reservation for the next nightit was really busy when we go there but we were seated immediatelyour server was really nice and very helpful when we told him we had never been there before we ordered the fried alligator appand loved every bite of iti had the filet mignon and rock lobster tailthe steak was cooked perfectly and was a good size for the priceim not usually a huge fan of lobster but wanted to give it a trypappadeux has changed my opinion about lobsterthe meat came right out of the tailit was buttery andjust plain yummy it was the first chance hubby and i really had a chance to go out to eat without the kidsso we really wanted to make the most of our timeand we wre definetly able to do that hererefills kept coming even after we had paid the billi also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the roomthe only thing thats keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the tables were too close to each otherand it was so loud i could hear the discussion at the table next to me but i had a hard time hearing my huband across the tablei will definetly be going back to pappadeux over and over again
__label__1 went for the free movies in the park free family movie series last night and really enjoyed myself the park has a giant inflatable movie screen where they show family movies every friday night at 7 in the early spring months get there early to get a spot closer to the screen and bring a picnic blanket to relax on it got a little chilly later in the evening i would bring a blanket to snuggle under too

__label__1 ive eaten here last year and this is the second year i finally am able to compare steaks to another location i love the decoration as its sports of all kinds theres always something new you havent seen before its the perfect place to eat and study what is around you i had the crusted parmesan cheese steak i had tomato bisque and the string onions those are good i had the steak and it felt like it was missing something im not sure what as i dont eat steak a lot the soup was great it was a cup and perfect the onion strings were good the steak was ok ill always go back but not for steak i also wish their menu was more broad with more items to choose from
__label__1 camus is a cute little trendy barrestaurant located in the clarendon hotel i came here for a business lunch awhile ago and really enjoyed it we were one of two tables though so service was top notch our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer any and all questions we had the chef even came out to say a hello which i found to be impressive the calamari app was excellent and my dish of mushroom gnocchi was amazing i definitely recommend this place
__label__0 mehdecent filibertos knockoff but the place feels like a major health hazard considering how new it is just think filibertos with less quality control and smaller portions
__label__1 first im sorry this review is lengthy but i really want people to understand how far a little kindness can go i entered mimis cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever i came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named danielle she gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before i looked at the menu for some time unable to clear my mind enough to decide she told me i was welcome to take a seat and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley wheres the fire take your time can i get you a glass of wine while you decide wine was a perfect idea i finally ordered and sat drinking my wine i waited and then waited a little longer danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine when she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help it was just the olive branch i needed just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion finally my food was ready she boxed everything with care for the drive home all this time smiling i couldnt help but notice danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange she had brightened my day and it was clear she is a light for others in mimis cafe this is the kickermy bill was 30 and some changei gave her what i thought was two 20 dollar bills but in reality was a 50 and a 20 the young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir im not sure these bills are right i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no i thought they were two 20s but the difference would be her reward for honesty the food was tasty and just what i needed mimis cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table and if mimis cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in danielle
__label__0 i wasnt that impressed the machines look old and rusted there didnt seem to be any airconditioning and it had to be in the 90s inside since it was about 110 outside they did have overhead fans the price was cheap45 cents per load to wash in a top loader but we only found one toploader available that actually worked half of them were out of order instead we dumped everything into two front loaders that claimed to do double loads and were out of there in pretty short order we took the clothes back to my daughters apartment building to dry in the laundry room there so she didnt have to stay with them
__label__1 im sure most people dont go to a fancy steak restaurant for the mac n cheese but as a mac aficionado its practically my duty and the mac here well its high quality i like to order the lobster mac sans lobster not a big fan of seafood which without the seafood is actually quite inexpensive now be warned this is real heavy mac n cheese its so cheesy and thick and delicious dont plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it
